% ==================== Toxicity Thresholds ====================

% Now it's time to specify the random generation of enrolling
% participants.  Each participant *on arrival* presents only the
% arrival time and a toxicity threshold.  The work above suffices
% for generating the arrival times; I must next consider how to
% sample the toxicity thresholds.

% The log-normally distributed MTD·µ¢ of "What Were They Thinking?" [1]
% would seem to be ideal here.

% 1. Norris DC. What Were They Thinking? Pharmacologic priors implicit
%    in a choice of 3+3 dose-escalation design. arXiv:201205301
%    [statME]. December 24, 2020. https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05301

% Now lognormal distributions always bring up the issue of _scale_,
% with the Œº parameter being problematic.  What is the scale here?
% What would it mean to have MTD·µ¢ ~ Lognorm(Œº,œÉ)?

% A quick reminder about reading the Lognormal parameters: it is best
% to write them as log(Œº) and log(œÉ), respectively, thereby referring
% them quantities Œº and œÉ that act _on the dose scale_.

% When MDT·µ¢ ~ Lognormal(log(Œº), log(œÉ)), then we have the very simple
% story that median MTD·µ¢ is Œº, and that doses Œº/œÉ and Œº*œÉ bracket a
% range between the 16% and 84% points on the CDF.  This means that
% half of individuals in the population will have a DLT at dose Œº,
% whereas only 16% will have one at Œº/œÉ but 84% will at dose Œº*œÉ.

% To support this intuition, let's _tabulate_ the CDF at various
% values of Œº and œÉ.

    Mu is Mu_,
    Sigma is Sigma_,
    Doses = [1,2,3,4,5,6],

    maplist(\P^P_^(P_ is round(1000*P)/1000), Ps, Probs).

% Now, at long last, we need a queue servicing function that takes a
% current trial state to a new one upon admitting a new participant.
% Of course, this requires that we specify what this state is!

% - Rx ‚àà 0..D, the current dose recommendation
% - Ws, a queue of enrolled participants Waiting for dose assignments
% - As, a keysort/2-ed list of Time-A for future Arrivals/Assessments:
%   - Arrivals are denoted arr(MTD)
%   - Assessments are denoted ao(d) or ax(d).
