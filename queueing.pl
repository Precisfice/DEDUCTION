% ==================== Toxicity Thresholds ====================

% Now it's time to specify the random generation of enrolling
% participants.  Each participant *on arrival* presents only the
% arrival time and a toxicity threshold.  The work above suffices
% for generating the arrival times; I must next consider how to
% sample the toxicity thresholds.

% The log-normally distributed MTD·µ¢ of "What Were They Thinking?" [1]
% would seem to be ideal here.
%
% 1. Norris DC. What Were They Thinking? Pharmacologic priors implicit
%    in a choice of 3+3 dose-escalation design. arXiv:201205301
%    [statME]. December 24, 2020. https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05301

% Now lognormal distributions always bring up the issue of _scale_,
% with the Œº parameter being problematic.  What is the scale here?
% What would it mean to have MTD·µ¢ ~ Lognorm(Œº,œÉ)?

% A quick reminder about reading the Lognormal parameters: it is best
% to write them as log(Œº) and log(œÉ), respectively, thereby referring
% them quantities Œº and œÉ that act _on the dose scale_.

% When MDT·µ¢ ~ Lognormal(log(Œº), log(œÉ)), then we have the very simple
% story that median MTD·µ¢ is Œº, and that doses Œº/œÉ and Œº*œÉ bracket a
% range between the 16% and 84% points on the CDF.  This means that
% half of individuals in the population will have a DLT at dose Œº,
% whereas only 16% will have one at Œº/œÉ but 84% will at dose Œº*œÉ.

% To support this intuition, let's _tabulate_ the CDF at various
% values of Œº and œÉ.

    Sigma is Sigma_,
    Doses = [1,2,3,4,5,6],

% At any time, the realized state consists of:
% - a tally of completed assessments ('the current tally')
% - a queue of _waiting_ enrollees, which may grow during intervals
%   when pending assessments are keeping the tally so pessimistic
%   that the current recommended dose is zero.

% Additionally, there is 'unrealized state' in the form of a time-series
% of all upcoming events, which are all either:
% - resolutions of pending assessments (time, dose, 0..1), or
% - new arrivals (time, MTD·µ¢).

% The evolution of this state should generate a list of events
% described by a DCG.

% Servicing of a new arrival at time t requires the following steps:
% 1. Tally any assessments that have resolved before time t
% 2. Construct a 'pessimistic' tally by tallying all still-pending
%    assessments as toxicities
% 3. Based on this pessimistic tally, determine enrolling dose d·µ¢
% 4. If arrival's MTD·µ¢ exceeds d·µ¢, record a pending non-toxicity
%    to be resolved at time T+Œî.  Otherwise, calculate the delay
%    to observation of the toxic respons via to exp(d·µ¢ - MTD·µ¢),
%    and schedule a pending toxicity accordingly.
% 5. In case d·µ¢ = 0, but the *actual* current tally would permit
%    enrollment, place the arrival in the _waiting_ queue. 

% The above requires maintaining several FIFO queues, but because
% these are indexed by time, their representation requires only
% pairlists, which are easily sorted.  Note moreover that, with
% arrivals occuring in ‚Ñùeal time, all arrival times are distinct.

% Furthermore, since we can quickly keysort/2 this pending-assessments
% list by _time_, there is no need to pursue the efficiencies of a
% list-differences formulation.

% By recognizing that the _state_ of the trial consists of a pair Q-P
% of 'pessimistic' current tally Q with pending assessents P, we can
% reduce the arity of these predicates.
