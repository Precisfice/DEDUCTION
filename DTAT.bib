          Radiotherapy has been striving to find markers of radiotherapy sensitivity for decades. In recent years the community has spent significant resources on exploring the wide range of omics data-sets to find that elusive perfect biomarker. One such candidate termed the “Radiosensitivity Index”, “RSI” for short, has been heavily publicized as a marker suitable for making dose-adjustments in the clinical setting. However, none of the analyses conducted, thus far, has assessed whether “RSI” explains enough of the outcome variance to elucidate a dose-response empirically. Here we re-analyze a pan-cancer data-set and find that “RSI” is no better than random chance at explaining outcome variance, overall survival times. For completeness, we then assessed whether “RSI” captured a sufficient amount of outcome variance to elucidate a dose-response, it did not. These results suggest that like the initial in-vitro analysis 12 years previously “RSI” is not a marker of radiotherapy sensitivity and is thus not fit to be used in any dose-adjustment algorithms.},

	abstract = {Summary
            Identification of the optimal dose presents a major challenge in drug development with molecularly targeted agents, immunotherapy, as well as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell treatments. By casting dose finding as a Bayesian model selection problem, we propose an adaptive design by simultaneously incorporating the toxicity and efficacy outcomes to select the optimal biological dose (OBD) in phase I/II clinical trials. Without imposing any parametric assumption or shape constraint on the underlying dose–response curves, we specify curve-free models for both the toxicity and efficacy endpoints to determine the OBD. By integrating the observed data across all dose levels, the proposed design is coherent in dose assignment and thus greatly enhances efficiency and accuracy in pinning down the right dose. Not only does our design possess a completely new yet flexible dose-finding framework, but it also has satisfactory and robust performance as demonstrated by extensive simulation studies. In addition, we show that our design enjoys desirable coherence properties, while most of existing phase I/II designs do not. We further extend the design to accommodate late-onset outcomes which are common in immunotherapy. The proposed design is exemplified with a phase I/II clinical trial in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adaptive model-based dose-finding designs have demonstrated advantages over traditional rule-based designs but have increased statistical complexity but uptake has been slow especially outside of cancer trials. TRAFIC is a multi-centre, early phase trial in rheumatoid arthritis incorporating a model-based design.
METHODS: A Bayesian adaptive dose-finding phase I trial rolling into a single-arm, single-stage phase II trial. Model parameters for phase I were chosen via Monte Carlo simulation evaluating objective performance measures under clinically relevant scenarios and incorporated stopping rules for early termination. Potential designs were further calibrated utilising dose transition pathways.
DISCUSSION: TRAFIC is an MRC-funded trial of a re-purposed treatment demonstrating that it is possible to design, fund and implement a model-based phase I trial in a non-cancer population within conventional research funding tracks and regulatory constraints. The phase I design allows borrowing of information from previous trials, all accumulated data to be utilised in decision-making, verification of operating characteristics through simulation, improved understanding for management and oversight teams through dose transition pathways. The rolling phase II design brings efficiencies in trial conduct including site and monitoring activities and cost. TRAFIC is the first funded model-based dose-finding trial in inflammatory disease demonstrating that small phase I/II trials can have an underlying statistical basis for decision-making and interpretation.

	abstract = {A review of the typical clinical course, diagnosis and treatment of acetaminophen toxicity is provided. For an acute overdose, most adults must ingest about 12g or more acetaminophen (APAP) before risk of serious hepatotoxicity is of concern. A nomogram of serum APAP concentration vs hours post-ingestion can assist in determining risk of liver injury and need for treatment. However, histories concerning the time of ingestion and the amount of drug ingested are usually unreliable. Peak serum transaminase activities usually occur 48-96h after acute ingestion. It is possible for patients to present in liver failure days after ingestion with undetectable serum APAP concentrations. Patients who have chronically ingested excessive APAP doses and develop hepatotoxicity usually present with such, and renal failure is more common in this population. Current treatment centers on administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to prevent hepatotoxicity, though NAC also improves outcomes in patients who present with acute liver failure. When given early after APAP ingestion, NAC's main mechanism of action is to maintain intracellular glutathione stores so to detoxify the electrophilic APAP metabolite, NAPQI. NAC is generally well-tolerated when given intravenously, with the main concern being anaphylactoid reactions. These reactions usually occur during loading doses and are easily treated with discontinuation of the NAC infusion, administration of antihistamines, and then restarting the loading dose at a slower infusion rate. There is concern that current NAC dosing is not large enough to adequately treat large APAP ingestions. Patients with acute liver failure may be candidates for orthotopic liver transplantation.},

	abstract = {Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is one of the most popular and widely used drugs for the treatment of pain and fever. It occupies a unique position among analgesic drugs. Unlike NSAIDs it is almost unanimously considered to have no antiinflammatory activity and does not produce gastrointestinal damage or untoward cardiorenal effects. Unlike opiates it is almost ineffective in intense pain and has no depressant effect on respiration. Although paracetamol has been used clinically for more than a century, its mode of action has been a mystery until about one year ago, when two independent groups (Zygmunt and colleagues and Bertolini and colleagues) produced experimental data unequivocally demonstrating that the analgesic effect of paracetamol is due to the indirect activation of cannabinoid CB(1) receptors. In brain and spinal cord, paracetamol, following deacetylation to its primary amine (p-aminophenol), is conjugated with arachidonic acid to form N-arachidonoylphenolamine, a compound already known (AM404) as an endogenous cannabinoid. The involved enzyme is fatty acid amide hydrolase. N-arachidonoylphenolamine is an agonist at TRPV1 receptors and an inhibitor of cellular anandamide uptake, which leads to increased levels of endogenous cannabinoids; moreover, it inhibits cyclooxygenases in the brain, albeit at concentrations that are probably not attainable with analgesic doses of paracetamol. CB(1) receptor antagonist, at a dose level that completely prevents the analgesic activity of a selective CB(1) receptor agonist, completely prevents the analgesic activity of paracetamol. Thus, paracetamol acts as a pro-drug, the active one being a cannabinoid. These findings finally explain the mechanism of action of paracetamol and the peculiarity of its effects, including the behavioral ones. Curiously, just when the first CB(1) agonists are being introduced for pain treatment, it comes out that an indirect cannabino-mimetic had been extensively used (and sometimes overused) for more than a century.},

This results in frequent suspension of patient enrollment. The issue is exacerbated in recent immune-oncology trials where toxicity outcomes can take a long time to observe. We propose a novel phase I design, the probability-of-decision toxicity probability interval (PoD-TPI) design, to accelerate phase I trials. PoD-TPI enables dose assignment in real-time in the presence of pending toxicity outcomes. With uncertain outcomes, the dose assignment decisions are treated as a random variable, and we calculate the posterior distribution of the decisions. The posterior distribution reflects the variability in the pending outcomes and allows a direct and intuitive evaluation of the confidence of all possible decisions. Optimal decisions are calculated based on 0-1 loss, and extra safety rules are constructed to enforce sufficient protection from exposing patients to risky doses. A new and useful feature of PoD-TPI is that it allows investigators and regulators to balance the trade-off between enrollment speed and making risky decisions by tuning a pair of intuitive design parameters. Through numerical studies, we evaluate the operating characteristics of PoD-TPI and demonstrate that PoD-TPI shortens trial duration and maintains trial safety and efficiency compared to existing time-to-event designs.},

            Venetoclax is a highly potent, selective BCL2 inhibitor capable of inducing apoptosis in cells dependent on BCL2 for survival. Most myeloma is MCL1-dependent; however, a subset of myeloma enriched for translocation t(11;14) is codependent on BCL2 and thus sensitive to venetoclax. The biology underlying this heterogeneity remains poorly understood. We show that knockdown of cyclin D1 does not induce resistance to venetoclax, arguing against a direct role for cyclin D1 in venetoclax sensitivity. To identify other factors contributing to venetoclax response, we studied a panel of 31 myeloma cell lines and 25 patient samples tested for venetoclax sensitivity. In cell lines, we corroborated our previous observation that BIM binding to BCL2 correlates with venetoclax response and further showed that knockout of BIM results in decreased venetoclax sensitivity. RNA-sequencing analysis identified expression of B-cell genes as enriched in venetoclax-sensitive myeloma, although no single gene consistently delineated sensitive and resistant cells. However, a panel of cell surface makers correlated well with ex vivo prediction of venetoclax response in 21 patient samples and may serve as a biomarker independent of t(11;14). Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing of myeloma cell lines also identified an epigenetic program in venetoclax-sensitive cells that was more similar to B cells than that of venetoclax-resistant cells, as well as enrichment for basic leucine zipper domain–binding motifs such as BATF. Together, these data indicate that remnants of B-cell biology are associated with BCL2 dependency and point to novel biomarkers of venetoclax-sensitive myeloma independent of t(11;14).},

METHODS: To better characterize this sequence, we reviewed 81 phase I trials based on this concept.
RESULTS: Out of 198 phase I oncology trials, 81 (41\%) are based on modified-Fibonacci series. Actual incremental ratios varied in a large range from 0.80 to 2.08. The median of actual increments was about 2.00, 1.50, 1.33, 1.33, 1.33, 1.33, 1.30, 1.35…. The "modified Fibonacci-sequence" gathers heterogeneous variation of the genuine sequence, which does not tend to a constant number at higher dose-levels.
CONCLUSION: This confusing term should be avoided.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE
              Simulation studies have shown that novel designs such as the continual reassessment method and the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design outperform the 3 + 3 design by recommending the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) more often, using less patients, and allotting more patients to the MTD. However, it is not clear whether these novel designs would have yielded different results in the context of real-world dose-finding trials. This is a commonly mentioned reason for the continuous use of 3 + 3 designs for oncology trials, with investigators considering simulation studies not sufficiently convincing to warrant the additional design complexity of novel designs.
            
            
              METHODS
              We randomly sampled 60 published dose-finding trials to obtain 22 that used the 3 + 3 design, identified an MTD, published toxicity data, and had more than two dose levels. We compared the published MTD with the estimated MTD using the continual reassessment method and BOIN using target toxicity rates of 25\% and 30\% and toxicity data from the trial. Moreover, we compared patient allocation and sample size assuming that these novel designs had been implemented.
            
            
              RESULTS
              Model-based designs chose dose levels higher than the published MTD in about 40\% of the trials, with estimated and observed toxicity rates closer to the target toxicity rates of 25\% and 30\%. They also assigned less patients to suboptimal doses and permitted faster dose escalation.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              This study using published dose-finding trials shows that novel designs would recommend different MTDs and confirms the advantages of these designs compared with the 3 + 3 design, which were demonstrated by simulation studies.},

	volume = {31},
	abstract = {At Sandia National Laboratories, we are currently engaged in research involving massively-parallel processing. There is considerable skepticism regarding the viability of massive parallelism; the skepticism centers around Amdahl’s law, an argument put forth by Gene Amdahl in 1967 [1] that even when the fraction of serial work in a given problem is small, say s, the maximum speedup obtainable from even an infinite number of parallel processors is only 1/s. We now have timing results for a 1024-processor system that demonstrate that the assumptions underlying Amdahl’s 1967 argument are inappropriate for the current approach to massive ensemble parallelism. If N is the number of processors, s is the amount of time spent (by a serial processor) on serial parts of a program and p is the amount of time spent (by a serial processor) on parts of the program that can be done in parallel, then Amdahl’s law says that speedup is given by Speedup = (s + p)  ⁄  ( s + p ⁄ N) = 1 ⁄  ( s + p ⁄ N), where we have set total time s␣+␣p ␣=␣1 for algebraic simplicity. For N = 1024, this is an unforgivingly steep function of s near s = 0 (see Figure 1). The steepness of the graph near s = 0 (approximately – N 2) implies that very few problems will experience even a 100-fold speedup. Yet for three very practical applications (s = 0.4 – 0.8 percent) used at Sandia, we have achieved the speedup factors on a 1024-processor hypercube which we believe are unprecedented [2]: 1021 for beam stress analysis using conjugate gradients, 1020 for baffled surface wave simulation using explicit finite differences, and 1016 for unstable fluid flow using flux-corrected transport. How can this be, when Amdahl’s argument would predict otherwise?},

	title = {Accelerated titration designs for phase {I} clinical trials in oncology},
	volume = {89},
	doi = {10.1093/jnci/89.15.1138},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many cancer patients in phase I clinical trials are treated at doses of chemotherapeutic agents that are below the biologically active level, thus reducing their chances for therapeutic benefit. Current phase I trials often take a long time to complete and provide little information about interpatient variability or cumulative toxicity.
PURPOSE: Our objective was to develop alternative designs for phase I trials so that fewer patients are treated at subtherapeutic dose levels, trials are of reduced duration, and important information (i.e., cumulative toxicity and maximum tolerated dose) needed to plan phase II trials is obtained.
METHODS: We fit a stochastic model to data from 20 phase I trials involving the study of nine different drugs. We then simulated new data from the model with the parameters estimated from the actual trials and evaluated the performance of alternative phase I designs on this simulated data. Four designs were evaluated. Design 1 was a conventional design (similar to the commonly used modified Fibonacci method) using cohorts of three to six patients, with 40\% dose-step increments and no intrapatient dose escalation. Designs 2 through 4 included only one patient per cohort until one patient experienced dose-limiting toxic effects or two patients experienced grade 2 toxic effects (during their first course of treatment for designs 2 and 3 or during any course of treatment for design 4). Designs 3 and 4 used 100\% dose steps during this initial accelerated phase. After the initial accelerated phase, designs 2 through 4 resorted to standard cohorts of three to six patients, with 40\% dose-step increments. Designs 2 through 4 used intrapatient dose escalation if the worst toxicity is grade 0-1 in the previous course for that patient.
RESULTS: Only three of the actual trials demonstrated cumulative toxic effects of the chemotherapeutic agents in patients. The average number of patients required for a phase I trial was reduced from 39.9 for design 1 to 24.4, 20.7, and 21.2 for designs 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The average number of patients who would be expected to have grade 0-1 toxicity as their worst toxicity over three cycles of treatment is 23.3 for design 1, but only 7.9, 3.9, and 4.8 for designs 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The average number of patients with grade 3 toxicity as their worst toxicity increases from 5.5 for design 1 to 6.2, 6.8, and 6.2 for designs 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The average number of patients with grade 4 toxicity as their worst toxicity increases from 1.9 for design 1 to 3.0, 4.3, and 3.2 for designs 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Accelerated titration (i.e., rapid intrapatient drug dose escalation) designs appear to effectively reduce the number of patients who are under-treated, speed the completion of phase I trials, and provide a substantial increase in the information obtained.},

	abstract = {A number of novel model-based and model-assisted designs have been proposed to find the MTD in phase I clinical trials, but their differences and relative pros and cons are not clear to many practitioners. We review three model-based designs, including the continual reassessment method (CRM), dose escalation with overdose control (EWOC), and Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM), and three model-assisted designs, including the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI), Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN), and keyboard (equivalently mTPI-2) designs. We conduct numerical studies to assess their accuracy, safety, and reliability and the practical implications of various empirical rules used in some designs, such as skipping a dose and imposing overdose control. Our results show that the CRM outperforms EWOC and BLRM with higher accuracy of identifying the MTD. For the CRM, skipping a dose is not recommended, as it substantially increases the chance of overdosing patients while providing limited gain for identifying the MTD. EWOC and BLRM appear excessively conservative. They are safe but have relatively poor accuracy of finding the MTD. The BOIN and keyboard (equivalently mTPI-2) designs have similar operating characteristics, outperforming the mTPI, but the BOIN is more intuitive and transparent. The BOIN yields competitive performance comparable with the CRM but is simpler to implement and free of the issue of irrational dose assignment caused by model misspecification, thereby providing an attractive approach for designing phase I trials.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Salvage options for patients who relapse after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (allo-SCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplasia (MDS) remain limited, and novel treatment strategies are required. Both lenalidomide (LEN) and azacitidine (AZA) possess significant antitumor activity effect in AML. Administration of LEN post-transplantation is associated with excessive rates of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but AZA has been shown to ameliorate GVHD in murine transplantation models. We therefore examined the tolerability and activity of combined LEN/AZA administration in post-transplantation relapse.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients who had relapsed after allo-SCT for AML (n = 24) or MDS (n = 5) were treated with sequential AZA (75 mg/m2 for 7 days) followed by escalating doses of LEN on days 10 to 30. Dose allocation and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation were guided by a modified Bayesian continuous reassessment method (CRM).
RESULTS: Sequential AZA and LEN therapy was well tolerated. The MTD of post-transplantation LEN, in combination with AZA, was determined as 25 mg daily. Three patients developed grade 2 to 4 GVHD. There was no GVHD-related mortality. Seven of 15 (47\%) patients achieved a major clinical response after LEN/AZA therapy. CD8+ T cells demonstrated impaired interferon-γ/tumor necrosis factor-α production at relapse, which was not reversed during LEN/AZA administration.
CONCLUSION: We conclude LEN can be administered safely post-allograft in conjunction with AZA, and this combination demonstrates clinical activity in relapsed AML/MDS without reversing biologic features of T-cell exhaustion. The use of a CRM model delivered improved efficiency in MTD assessment and provided additional flexibility. Combined LEN/AZA therapy represents a novel and active salvage therapy in patients who had relapsed post-allograft.},

	abstract = {The ever-increasing pace of development of novel therapies mandates efficient methodologies for assessment of their tolerability and activity. Evidence increasingly support the merits of model-based dose-finding designs in identifying the recommended phase II dose compared with conventional rule-based designs such as the 3 + 3 but despite this, their use remains limited. Here, we propose a useful tool, dose transition pathways (DTP), which helps overcome several commonly faced practical and methodologic challenges in the implementation of model-based designs. DTP projects in advance the doses recommended by a model-based design for subsequent patients (stay, escalate, de-escalate, or stop early), using all the accumulated information. After specifying a model with favorable statistical properties, we utilize the DTP to fine-tune the model to tailor it to the trial's specific requirements that reflect important clinical judgments. In particular, it can help to determine how stringent the stopping rules should be if the investigated therapy is too toxic. Its use to design and implement a modified continual reassessment method is illustrated in an acute myeloid leukemia trial. DTP removes the fears of model-based designs as unknown, complex systems and can serve as a handbook, guiding decision-making for each dose update. In the illustrated trial, the seamless, clear transition for each dose recommendation aided the investigators' understanding of the design and facilitated decision-making to enable finer calibration of a tailored model. We advocate the use of the DTP as an integral procedure in the co-development and successful implementation of practical model-based designs by statisticians and investigators.

	doi = {10.1200/JCO.2013.52.3993},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: LCL161 antagonizes the function of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), thereby promoting cancer cell death. This first-in-human dose-escalation study assessed the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of LCL161 in patients with advanced solid tumors. A second part of the study assessed the relative bioavailability of a tablet versus solution formulation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: LCL161 was administered orally, once weekly, on a 21-day cycle to adult patients with advanced solid tumors by using an adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control-guided dose escalation.
RESULTS: Fifty-three patients received at least one dose of LCL161 (dose range, 10 to 3,000 mg). LCL161 was well tolerated at doses up to 1,800 mg. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was the only dose-limiting toxicity (in three [6\%] of 53 patients) and was the most common grades 3 to 4 event (in five [9\%] of 53 patients). Vomiting, nausea, asthenia/fatigue, and anorexia were common but not severe. Although the MTD was not formally determined, an 1,800-mg dose was selected in compliance with the protocol for additional study, given the dose-limiting CRS at higher doses and pharmacodynamic activity at lower doses. LCL161 was rapidly absorbed, and exposure was generally increased with dose. The tablet formulation of LCL161 was better tolerated than the solution; tablet and solution formulations had similar exposures, and the solution was discontinued. No patient had an objective response. LCL161 induced degradation of cellular IAP1 protein in the blood, skin, and tumor and increased circulating cytokine levels.
CONCLUSION: The 1,800-mg dose of LCL161, administered as a single agent once weekly, in tablet formulation is the recommended dose for additional study. This combined dose and formulation was well tolerated and had significant pharmacodynamic activity, which warrants additional investigation.},

	abstract = {The continual reassessment method (CRM) is a popular dose-finding design for phase I clinical trials. This method requires that practitioners prespecify the toxicity probability at each dose. Such prespecification can be arbitrary, and different specifications of toxicity probabilities may lead to very different design properties. To overcome the arbitrariness and further enhance the robustness of the design, we propose using multiple parallel CRM models, each with a different set of prespecified toxicity probabilities. In the Bayesian paradigm, we assign a discrete probability mass to each CRM model as the prior model probability. The posterior probabilities of toxicity can be estimated by the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach. Dose escalation or deescalation is determined by comparing the target toxicity rate and the BMA estimates of the dose toxicity probabilities. We examine the properties of the BMA-CRM approach through extensive simulation studies, and also compare this new method and its variants with the original CRM. The results demonstrate that our BMA-CRM is competitive and robust, and eliminates the arbitrariness of the prespecification of toxicity probabilities.},

The consequences of this heterogeneity are particularly evident in the management of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This review will discuss the benefits and challenges of incorporating precision medicine into early- through late-phase metastatic NSCLC clinical trials, discussing examples of drug development programs in oncogene- and non-oncogene-addicted NSCLC. The experiences of clinical development of crizotinib, gefitinib and osimertinib are depicted showing that when a targeted drug is administrated in a study population not selected by any biomarker, trials could produce negative results. However, the early detection of biomarker-driven biology helps to obtain a greater benefit for a selected population and can reduce the required time for drug approval. Early clinical development programs involving nivolumab, pembrolizumab and avelumab, immune checkpoint inhibitors, taught us that, beyond safety and activity, the optimal selection of patients should be based on pre-specified biomarkers. Overall, the identification of predictive biomarkers is one of the greatest challenges of NSCLC research that should be optimized with solid methodological trial designs to maximize the clinical outcomes.},

However, it remains unclear whether their dose, duration, and timing may affect clinical efficacy. Here, we determined the impact of corticosteroids on clinical outcomes in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with standard of care anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Among 100 patients evaluated, 60 (60\%) received corticosteroids for management of CAR T-cell therapy-associated toxicities. The median cumulative dexamethasone-equivalent dose was 186 mg (range, 8-1803) and the median duration of corticosteroid treatment was 9 days (range, 1-30). Corticosteroid treatment was started between days 0 and 7 in 45 (75\%) patients and beyond day 7 in 15 (25\%). After a median follow-up of 10 months (95\% confidence interval, 8-12 months), use of higher cumulative dose of corticosteroids was associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival. More importantly, higher cumulative dose of corticosteroids, and prolonged and early use after CAR T-cell infusion were associated with significantly shorter overall survival. These results suggest that corticosteroids should be used at the lowest dose and for the shortest duration and their initiation should be delayed whenever clinically feasible while managing CAR T-cell therapy-associated toxicities.},

	abstract = {Concepts elucidated from preclinical pharmacology studies have made a substantial impact on the clinical use of anticancer drugs. However, the majority of animal pharmacology results have not been available until after drugs have entered clinical trials. Since clinical pharmacokinetic measurements are already part of many phase I trials, human data could be directly compared with mouse data if mouse pharmacology studies were completed before clinical trials were initiated. Once the starting dose in a phase I clinical trial has been evaluated, subsequent doses are escalated until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. The rate of escalation is empirically defined by a modified Fibonacci series. This universal escalation scheme is applied to all drugs, with no modifications based upon pharmacology or other factors. If the starting dose is far removed from the maximum tolerated dose, a large number of dose escalations are required. Consequently, most patients receive subtherapeutic doses, and the amount of resources allocated to each drug increases. We are exploring potential strategies for controlling the rate of dose escalation based upon pharmacokinetic determinations in mouse and man. Retrospective analyses indicate that 20\%-50\% savings in the total number of dose escalations are possible.},

              To prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of risk-adapted preemptive tocilizumab (PT) administration in preventing severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after CTL019, a CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.
            
            
              METHODS
              Children and young adults with CD19-positive relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia were assigned to high- (≥ 40\%) or low- ({\textless} 40\%) tumor burden cohorts (HTBC or LTBC) based on a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy before infusion. HTBC patients received a single dose of tocilizumab (8-12 mg/kg) after development of high, persistent fevers. LTBC patients received standard CRS management. The primary end point was the frequency of grade 4 CRS (Penn scale), with an observed rate of ≤ 5 of 15 patients in the HTBC pre-defined as clinically meaningful. In post hoc analyses, the HTBC was compared with a historical cohort of high-tumor burden patients from the initial phase I CTL019 trial.
            
            
              RESULTS
              The primary end point was met. Seventy patients were infused with CTL019, 15 in the HTBC and 55 in the LTBC. All HTBC patients received the PT intervention. The incidence of grade 4 CRS was 27\% (95\% CI, 8 to 55) in the HTBC and 3.6\% (95\% CI, 0.4 to 13) in the LTBC. The best overall response rate was 87\% in the HTBC and 100\% in the LTBC. Initial CTL019 expansion was greater in the HTBC than the LTBC ( P {\textless} .001), but persistence was not different ( P = .73). Event-free and overall survival were worse in the HTBC ( P = .004, P {\textless} .001, respectively). In the post hoc analysis, grade 4 CRS was observed in 27\% versus 50\% of patients in the PT and prior phase I cohorts, respectively ( P = .18).
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Risk-adapted PT administration resulted in a decrease in the expected incidence of grade 4 CRS, meeting the study end point, without adversely impacting the antitumor efficacy or safety of CTL019.},

	abstract = {Preemptive administration of tocilizumab (toci) to manage cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy may reduce rates of serious CRS but conversely may worsen neurotoxicity or risk of infections. Optimal toci administration strategies for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) receiving B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed CAR-T therapies have not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to identify whether shorter time-to-toci intervals (hours between first fever attributed to CRS and first dose of toci) have any impact on therapy-related toxicities or clinical outcomes among patients with RRMM receiving BCMA-directed CAR-T therapies. We retrospectively analyzed our institution's experience with 4 BCMA-directed CAR-T therapies (idecabtagene vicleucel, bb21217, ciltacabtagene autoleucel, and orvacabtagene autoceucel) for RRMM over a 3-year period ending in June 2020. We divided patients based on the administration of toci and median time-to-toci interval into early-toci (time-to-toci ≤50th percentile), late-toci (time-to-toci {\textgreater}50th percentile), and no-toci (no toci received) groups. We compared the early-toci and late-toci groups with regard to patient characteristics, weight-based CAR-T toxicities, selected toxicities (CRS, neurotoxicity, macrophage activation syndrome, or infections), and clinical outcomes. Of 50 analyzed patients with a median follow-up of 15.3 months, 76\% (n = 38) received ≥1 dose of toci (range, 1 to 3) and were classified into early-toci (time-to-toci ≤12 hours) or late-toci (time-to-toci {\textgreater}12 hours) groups. The 2 groups (n = 19 each) had similar CRS grade distributions, hours to CRS onset, CRS-related biomarkers, and incidences of neurotoxicity or severe infections; however, weight-adjusted CAR-T cell doses were higher in the early-toci group (median 5.99 versus 3.80 × 106 cells/kg, P {\textless} 0.01). Peak CRS grades (range, 0 to 2) using American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy consensus criteria, neurotoxicity rates, and rates of severe infections were similar between groups; however, the median CRS duration was 18.6 hours for the early-toci group versus 84.7 hours for the late-toci group. The median progression-free survival was 35.7 months in the early-toci group and 13.2 months in the late-toci group. While limited by small sample size and known confounders such as CAR-T cell dose, our analysis suggests that preemptive toci strategies for CRS management with BCMA-directed CAR-T therapy-specifically, toci administration within 12 hours of the first fever attributed to CRS-do not appear to increase rates of therapy-related toxicities or compromise efficacy. However, total CRS duration may be shorter with early-toci workflows. Prospective validation of our findings may lead to improved safety and cost-effectiveness profiles for CAR-T therapy in RRMM.},

            Two useful strategies to speed up drug development are to increase the patient accrual rate and use novel adaptive designs. Unfortunately, these two strategies often conflict when the evaluation of the outcome cannot keep pace with the patient accrual rate and thus the interim data cannot be observed in time to make adaptive decisions. A similar logistic difficulty arises when the outcome is late-onset. Based on a novel formulation and approximation of the likelihood of the observed data, we propose a general methodology for model-assisted designs to handle toxicity data that are pending due to fast accrual or late-onset toxicity and facilitate seamless decision making in phase I dose-finding trials. The proposed time-to-event model-assisted designs consider each dose separately and the dose-escalation/de-escalation rules can be tabulated before the trial begins, which greatly simplifies trial conduct in practice compared to that under existing methods. We show that the proposed designs have desirable finite and large-sample properties and yield performance that is comparable to that of more complicated model-based designs. We provide user-friendly software for implementing the designs.},

	abstract = {Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is a paradigm-shifting immunotherapy modality in oncology; however, unique toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome limit its ability to be implemented more widely in the outpatient setting or at smaller-volume centers. Three operational challenges with CAR-T therapy include the following: (1) the logistics of toxicity monitoring, ie, with frequent vital sign checks and neurologic assessments; (2) the specialized knowledge required for toxicity management, particularly with regard to CRS and immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome; and (3) the need for high-quality symptomatic and supportive care during this intensive period. In this review, we explore potential niches for digital innovations that can improve the implementation of CAR-T therapy in each of these domains. These tools include patient-facing technologies and provider-facing platforms: for example, wearable devices and mobile health apps to screen for fevers and encephalopathy, electronic patient-reported outcome assessments–based workflows to assist with symptom management, machine learning algorithms to predict emerging CRS in real time, clinical decision support systems to assist with toxicity management, and digital coaching to help maintain wellness. Televisits, which have grown in prominence since the novel coronavirus pandemic, will continue to play a key role in the monitoring and management of CAR-T–related toxicities as well. Limitations of these strategies include the need to ensure care equity and stakeholder buy-in, both operationally and financially. Nevertheless, once developed and validated, the next-generation implementation of CAR-T therapy using these digital tools may improve both its safety and accessibility.},

	abstract = {Immunotherapy is an innovative treatment approach that stimulates a patient's immune system to fight cancer. It demonstrates characteristics distinct from conventional chemotherapy and stands to revolutionize cancer treatment. We propose a Bayesian phase I/II dosefinding design that incorporates the unique features of immunotherapy by simultaneously considering three outcomes: immune response, toxicity and efficacy. The objective is to identify the biologically optimal dose, defined as the dose with the highest desirability in the risk-benefit tradeoff. An Emax model is utilized to describe the marginal distribution of the immune response. Conditional on the immune response, we jointly model toxicity and efficacy using a latent variable approach. Using the accumulating data, we adaptively randomize patients to experimental doses based on the continuously updated model estimates. A simulation study shows that our proposed design has good operating characteristics in terms of selecting the target dose and allocating patients to the target dose.},

Successful phase II trials were those that met their primary endpoints. Dates of approval were obtained from the Drugs@FDA website in April 2014. A logistic regression model was used to determine the associations between variables and success in phase II.Results: We identified 533 phase I trials evaluating 381 drugs; 112 drugs had at least one phase I trial with an expansion cohort. Phase I trials with expansion cohorts of two to 20 patients were associated with a higher rate of successful phase II trials than those with no expansion cohort [48\% vs. 27\%; OR, 2.1; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-4.0; P = 0.037]. Phase II success rates were the same for expansion cohort with two to 20 and more than 20 patients (48\% vs. 52\%). Other positive associations were disease-specific trials (OR, 1.7; 95\% CI, 1.0-2.9; P = 0.037), industry sponsorship (OR, 2.9; 95\% CI, 1.5-5.7; P = 0.0024), and response rate of 6\% to 20\% (OR, 2.89; 95\% CI, 1.6-5.2; P = 0.0007). Drugs tested in phase I trials with expansion cohorts had a higher rate of 5-year approval (19\% vs. 5\%; HR, 4.4; 95\% CI, 2.2-8.8; P {\textless} 0.001).Conclusions: The use of expansion cohorts in phase I trials was associated with success of subsequent phase II trials.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We report the experience with 2,000 consecutive patients with advanced cancer who underwent testing on a genomic testing protocol, including the frequency of actionable alterations across tumor types, subsequent enrollment onto clinical trials, and the challenges for trial enrollment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Standardized hotspot mutation analysis was performed in 2,000 patients, using either an 11-gene (251 patients) or a 46- or 50-gene (1,749 patients) multiplex platform. Thirty-five genes were considered potentially actionable based on their potential to be targeted with approved or investigational therapies.
RESULTS: Seven hundred eighty-nine patients (39\%) had at least one mutation in potentially actionable genes. Eighty-three patients (11\%) with potentially actionable mutations went on genotype-matched trials targeting these alterations. Of 230 patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN/BRAF mutations that returned for therapy, 116 (50\%) received a genotype-matched drug. Forty patients (17\%) were treated on a genotype-selected trial requiring a mutation for eligibility, 16 (7\%) were treated on a genotype-relevant trial targeting a genomic alteration without biomarker selection, and 40 (17\%) received a genotype-relevant drug off trial. Challenges to trial accrual included patient preference of noninvestigational treatment or local treatment, poor performance status or other reasons for trial ineligibility, lack of trials/slots, and insurance denial.
CONCLUSION: Broad implementation of multiplex hotspot testing is feasible; however, only a small portion of patients with actionable alterations were actually enrolled onto genotype-matched trials. Increased awareness of therapeutic implications and access to novel therapeutics are needed to optimally leverage results from broad-based genomic testing.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We evaluated whether next-generation sequencing (NGS) of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) could be used for patient selection and as a tumor clone response biomarker in patients with advanced cancers participating in early-phase clinical trials of targeted drugs.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Plasma samples from patients with known tumor mutations who completed at least two courses of investigational targeted therapy were collected monthly, until disease progression. NGS was performed sequentially on the Ion Torrent PGM platform.
RESULTS: cfDNA was extracted from 39 patients with various tumor types. Treatments administered targeted mainly the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (n = 28) or MEK (n = 7). Overall, 159 plasma samples were sequenced with a mean sequencing coverage achieved of 1,685X across experiments. At trial initiation (C1D1), 23 of 39 (59\%) patients had at least one mutation identified in cfDNA (mean 2, range 1-5). Out of the 44 mutations identified at C1D1, TP53, PIK3CA and KRAS were the top 3 mutated genes identified, with 18 (41\%), 9 (20\%), 8 (18\%) different mutations, respectively. Out of these 23 patients, 13 received a targeted drug matching their tumor profile. For the 23 patients with cfDNA mutation at C1D1, the monitoring of mutation allele frequency (AF) in consecutive plasma samples during treatment with targeted drugs demonstrated potential treatment associated clonal responses. Longitudinal monitoring of cfDNA samples with multiple mutations indicated the presence of separate clones behaving discordantly. Molecular changes at cfDNA mutation level were associated with time to disease progression by RECIST criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted NGS of cfDNA has potential clinical utility to monitor the delivery of targeted therapies.},

We evaluated RECIST criteria-based overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) as potential surrogate endpoints of overall survival (OS), and explored a modified definition of PFS by altering the threshold percentage determining disease progression to assess the association with survival benefit in immunotherapy trials.Experimental Design: Thirteen randomized, multicenter, active-control trials containing immunotherapeutic agents submitted to the FDA were analyzed. Associations between treatment effects of ORR, PFS, modified PFS, and OS were evaluated at individual and trial levels. Patient-level responder analysis was performed for PFS and OS.Results: The coefficient of determination (R²) measured the strength of associations, where values near 1 imply surrogacy and values close to 0 suggest no association. At the trial level, the association between hazard ratios (HR) of PFS and OS was R2 = 0.1303, and between the odds ratio (OR) of ORR and HR of OS was R2 = 0.1277. At the individual level, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between PFS and OS was 0.61. Trial-level associations between modified PFS and OS ranged between 0.07 and 0.1, and individual-level correlations were approximately 0.6. HRs of PFS and OS for responders versus nonresponders were 0.129 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.11-0.15] and 0.118 (95\% CI, 0.11-0.13), respectively.Conclusions: Although responders exhibited longer survival and PFS than nonresponders, the trial-level and individual-level associations were weak between PFS/ORR and OS.

	abstract = {Traditionally, drug development has evaluated dose, safety, activity, and comparative benefit in a sequence of phases using trial designs and endpoints specifically devised for each phase. Innovations in drug development seek to consolidate the phases and rapidly expand accrual with "seamless" trial designs. Although consolidation and rapid accrual may yield efficiencies, widespread use of seamless first-in-human (FiH) trials without careful consideration of objectives, statistical analysis plans, or trial oversight raises concerns. A working group formed by the National Cancer Institute convened to consider and discuss opportunities and challenges for such trials as well as encourage responsible use of these designs. We reviewed all abstracts presented at American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meetings from 2010 to 2017 for FiH trials enrolling at least 100 patients. We identified 1786 early-phase trials enrolling 57 559 adult patients. Fifty-one of the trials (2.9\%) investigated 50 investigational new drugs, were seamless, and accounted for 14.6\% of the total patients. The seamless trials included a median of 3 (range = 1-13) expansion cohorts. The overall risk of clinically significant treatment-related adverse events (grade 3-4) was 49.1\% (range = 0.0-100\%), and seven studies reported at least one toxic death. Rapid expansion of FiH trials may lead to earlier drug approval and corresponding widespread patient access to active therapeutics. Nevertheless, seamless designs must adhere to established ethical, scientific, and statistical standards. Protocols should include prospectively planned analyses of efficacy in disease- or biomarker-defined cohorts of sufficient rigor to support accelerated approval.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been revolutionized by targeted therapies that either inhibit proliferation (ibrutinib) or reactivate apoptosis (venetoclax). Both significantly improve survival in CLL and replace chemoimmunotherapy for many patients. However, individually, they rarely lead to eradication of measurable residual disease (MRD) and usually are taken indefinitely or until progression. We present the CLARITY trial that combined ibrutinib with venetoclax to eradicate detectable CLL with the intention of stopping therapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: CLARITY is a phase II trial that combined ibrutinib with venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. The primary end point was eradication of MRD after 12 months of combined therapy. Key secondary end points were response by International Workshop on CLL criteria, safety, and progression-free and overall survival.
RESULTS: In 53 patients after 12 months of ibrutinib plus venetoclax, MRD negativity (fewer than one CLL cell in 10,000 leukocytes) was achieved in the blood of 28 (53\%) and the marrow of 19 (36\%). Forty-seven patients (89\%) responded, and 27 (51\%) achieved a complete remission. After a median follow-up of 21.1 months, one patient progressed, and all patients were alive. A single case of biochemical tumor lysis syndrome was observed. Other adverse effects were mild and/or manageable and most commonly were neutropenia or GI events.
CONCLUSION: The combination of ibrutinib plus venetoclax was well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. There was a high rate of MRD eradication that led to the cessation of therapy in some patients. The progression-free and overall survival rates are encouraging for relapsed and refractory CLL.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concerns have been recognized about the operating characteristics of the standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation design. Various innovative phase 1 trial designs have been proposed to address the issues and new challenges posed by molecularly targeted agents. However, in spite of these proposals, the conventional design is still the most widely utilized.
METHODS: A review of the literature of phase 1 trials and relevant statistical studies was performed.
RESULTS: Beyond statistical simulations, sparse clinical data exist to support or refute many of the shortcomings ascribed to the 3 + 3 rule method. Data from phase 1 trials demonstrate that traditional designs identified the correct dose and relevant toxicities with an acceptable level of precision in some instances; however, no single escalation method was proven superior in all circumstances.
CONCLUSIONS: Design selection should be guided by the principle of slow escalation in the face of toxicity and rapid dose increases in the setting of minimal or no adverse events. When the toxicity of a drug is uncertain or a narrow therapeutic window is suggested from preclinical testing, then a conservative 3 + 3 method is generally appropriate. However, if the therapeutic window is wide and the expected toxicity is low, then rapid escalation with a novel rule- or model-based design should be employed.},

The high prevalence of therapeutic misestimation and unrealistic optimism in particular has stimulated debate about whether unrealistic therapeutic beliefs in early-phase clinical trials preclude adequate informed consent. We seek here to help resolve this controversy by showing that a crucial determination of when such therapeutic beliefs are ethically problematic turns on whether they are causally linked and instrumental to the motivation to participate in the trial. Thus, in practice, it is ethically incumbent on researchers to determine which understanding and beliefs lead to the participant’s primary motivation for enrolling, not to simply assess understanding, beliefs and motivations independently. We further contend that assessing patient-subjects’ appreciation as a component of informed consent—it is already an established component of decision-making capacity assessments—can help elucidate the link between understanding-beliefs and motivation; appreciation refers to an individual’s understanding of the personal significance of both the medical facts and the experience of trial participation. Therefore, we recommend that: (1) in addition to the usual question, ‘Why do you want to participate in this trial?’, all potential participants should be asked the question: ‘What are you giving up by participating in this trial?’ and (2) researchers should consider the settings in which it may be possible and practical to obtain ‘two-point consent’.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms by which cells adapt to proteotoxic stress are largely unknown, but are key to understanding how tumor cells, particularly in vivo, are largely resistant to proteasome inhibitors. Analysis of cancer cell lines, mouse xenografts and patient-derived tumor samples all showed an association between mitochondrial metabolism and proteasome inhibitor sensitivity. When cells were forced to use oxidative phosphorylation rather than glycolysis, they became proteasome-inhibitor resistant. This mitochondrial state, however, creates a unique vulnerability: sensitivity to the small molecule compound elesclomol. Genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 screening showed that a single gene, encoding the mitochondrial reductase FDX1, could rescue elesclomol-induced cell death. Enzymatic function and nuclear-magnetic-resonance-based analyses further showed that FDX1 is the direct target of elesclomol, which promotes a unique form of copper-dependent cell death. These studies explain a fundamental mechanism by which cells adapt to proteotoxic stress and suggest strategies to mitigate proteasome inhibitor resistance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The combination of multikinase VEGF inhibitor regorafenib and anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab overcomes intrinsic and acquired resistance in both EGFR-sensitive and EGFR-resistant preclinical models of colorectal cancer (CRC).
METHODS: Utilizing a standard 3+3 design, a phase I study was designed to determine safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of the regorafenib plus cetuximab combination among patients with advanced cancer including CRC. Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on the exceptional responder.
RESULTS: Among the 27 patients enrolled the median age was 54 years. None of 19 patients treated at dose level 1 (cetuximab i.v. 200 mg/m2 followed by 150 mg/m2 weekly + regorafenib 80 mg daily) experienced a DLT, and 2 of 5 patients treated at dose level 2 (cetuximab i.v. 200 mg/m2 followed by 150 mg/m2 weekly + regorafenib 120 mg daily) experienced a DLT (grade 3 thrombocytopenia [n = 1] and grade 3 intra-abdominal bleed [n = 1]). Most common adverse events were grade 1 or 2 rash (20 patients). Of 24 evaluable patients, 11 (46\%) patients had clinical benefit (stable disease {\textgreater} 6 cycles or partial response [PR]) (CRC n = 8, one patient each with head and neck cancer, carcinoma of unknown primary, and glioblastoma). A CRC patient, who progressed on anti-EGFR and regorafenib, achieved a PR (46\% decrease per RECIST v1.1) lasting 15 months. Genomic profiling of an exceptional responder with response for over 27 cycles revealed hypermutated genotype with microsatellite instability (MSI).
CONCLUSION: Regorafenib 80 mg daily plus cetuximab 200 mg/m2 loading dose, followed by 150 mg/m2 every week is the MTD/recommended phase II dose. The combination demonstrated early signals of activity in wild-type CRC, including 1 exceptional responder with MSI high.

Preclinical data demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile and preserved or improved antitumor activity compared with cisplatin across animal models. We evaluated the safety and tolerability of NC-6004 and gemcitabine using a Bayesian continual reassessment model (N-CRM) to determine the optimal dose.Experimental Design: Patients with advanced solid tumors received NC-6004 at 60 to 180 mg/m2 on day 1 and gemcitabine at 1,250 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Dose escalation of NC-6004 began with a single patient run-in until a dose-limiting toxicity occurred at 180 mg/m2 Cohorts of four patients were enrolled at doses predicted by the N-CRM. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as having the greatest probability of target toxicity {\textless}25\%. Quality of life was assessed using EORTC-QLQ-C30.Results: Among 22 patients, the most common grade III/IV hematologic adverse events were leukopenia (68\%) and thrombocytopenia (59\%). Of 20 pretreated patients evaluable for response, half were previously exposed to a platinum agent. The MTD was 135 mg/m2 Nine patients were treated at the MTD with median treatment duration of 15 weeks (range, 3-50). Tumor shrinkage occurred in 11 (55\%), partial responses in 3 (15\%), and stable disease in 14 (70\%). Most patients reported stable or improved EORTC QLQ-C30 scores.Conclusions: Greater cisplatin equivalent doses were achieved with no clinically significant neuro-, oto-, or nephrotoxicity.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To address the challenging ethical dilemmas created from the participation of advanced cancer patients in phase I trials, we assessed the feasibility of a clinical trial design that uses an interactive informed consent process in which patient-subjects can choose to become directly involved in decisions of dose escalation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Subjects were advanced cancer patients in the Hematology/Oncology Clinics at the University of Chicago who were eligible to participate in a phase I trial in which they underwent a three-step informed consent process that used cohort-specific consent and allowed them the option to choose their own doses of the chemotherapeutic agents under study, vinorelbine (NVB) and paclitaxel (TAX), within predetermined limits. NVB and TAX were administered in conventional 21- to 28-day cycles for two cycles while on study. Dose escalation occurred when a patient-subject chose a higher untested dose after they received information on all previously assessable patient-subjects. In addition to the phase I trial itself, a survey that consisted of structured interviews, which sought to evaluate patients' experiences with the interactive subject-choice phase I trial design and consent process, was conducted with participating subjects. The phase I trial itself sought to determine the associated toxicities of the agents under study. The survey results were compared with a similar survey of a matched control population of subjects who participated in other concurrently active conventional phase I trials at our institution.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine patient-subjects participated in the phase I trial, with 24 who agreed to and completed the survey interviews. Seventy-six percent of patient-subjects opted to choose their dose of the agents under study, and 28\% chose the highest available doses. More than half of the patient-subjects (56\%) felt some degree of comfort in being asked to choose their dose of chemotherapy, with 53\% stating that being asked to choose their dose made them feel in control, fully informed, or content. However, there were no statistically significant improvements in objective measures of the informed consent process, which included surveyed subjects' stated understanding of either provided information about phase I trials and alternatives to trial participation or of the research purpose of phase I trials. By making choices, the group of patients in the interactive subject choice trial changed the size of the dose cohorts and modified the process of dose escalation in this phase I study.
CONCLUSION: Although complex, our innovative phase I trial design is feasible. In addition to the use of cohort-specific consent, the trial design may reduce the magnitude of many of the commonly recognized ethical dilemmas associated with this form of clinical research, which include difficulties with information provision and the understanding of possible risks and benefits of phase I trial participation, through direct subject involvement in research decision making by otherwise potentially vulnerable cancer patients.},

	abstract = {5027  Background: Sunitinib malate (SU) is an oral, multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFRs and PDGFRs, and has shown substantial antitumor activity in mRCC (Motzer et al, JAMA 2006 and ASCO 2006). This analysis describes SU, and total drug (TD; SU+SU12662 [active metabolite]) exposure-response relationships in mRCC using a population PKPD approach. Methods: PK and efficacy data from 3 studies (phase II and III) of SU (25–62.5 mg/day; 4 wks dosing followed by 2 wks off) in treatment-naïve (N=44) and cytokine-refractory mRCC pts (N=148) were analyzed. SU and SU12662 concentrations were fitted to a population PK model (a 2- compartment model for both parent and metabolite). Estimates of pt PK were used to calculate steady-state Area Under the Curve (AUCss) for SU, SU12662 and TD, which were used as the exposure measure in a PKPD analysis of partial response (PR) rates, time to tumor progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and tumor volume changes. Results: The probability of a PR for cytokine-refractory pts increased with increasing AUCss for SU and TD. The odds-ratio suggested a 2.6-fold increase in PR frequency for each unit increase in AUCss. Longer TTP and OS were also noted in pts with high SU and TD AUCss. In treatment-naïve pts on SU, there was very little observed tumor progression or death (only 5 pts progressed and only 1 death) limiting the ability to analyze exposure-response. A tumor growth dynamics model (developed to describe changes in tumor volume [by CT or MRI] in response to treatment, as a function of AUCss) provided a good description of tumor volume changes with SU for both treatment-naïve and cytokine-refractory pts. Efficacy was not related to baseline tumor volume, gender, or race. Based on this model, clinical trial simulations assuming perfect pt compliance predict that 62\% of pts would achieve a PR with SU 50 mg/day. Conclusions: SU and TD AUCss correlated significantly with the probability of a PR in cytokine- refractory pts, and longer TTP and OS. Limited data were available for treatment-naïve pts. The tumor growth dynamics model provided a good description of tumor volume changes with SU for both populations. This exposure-response analysis indicates that increased exposure to SU is associated with clinical benefit.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Phase I clinical trials of new anticancer therapies determine suitable doses for further testing. Optimization of their design is vital in that they enroll cancer patients whose well-being is distinctly at risk. This study examines the effectiveness of knowledge transfer about more effective statistical designs to clinical practice.
METHODS: We examined abstract records of cancer phase I trials from the Science Citation Index database between 1991 and 2006 and classified them into clinical (dose-finding trials) and statistical trials (methodologic studies of dose-escalation designs). We then mapped these two sets by tracking which trials adopted new statistical designs.
RESULTS: One thousand two hundred thirty-five clinical and 90 statistical studies were identified. Only 1.6\% of the phase I cancer trials (20 of 1,235 trials) followed a design proposed in one of the statistical studies. These 20 clinical studies showed extensive lags between publication of the statistical paper and its translation into a clinical paper. These 20 clinical trials followed Bayesian adaptive designs. The remainder used variations of the standard up-and-down method.
CONCLUSION: A consequence of using less effective designs is that more patients are treated with doses outside the therapeutic window. Simulation studies have shown that up-and-down designs treated only 35\% of patients at optimal dose levels versus 55\% for Bayesian adaptive designs. This implies needless loss of treatment efficacy and, possibly, lives. We suggest that regulatory agencies (eg, US Food and Drug Administration) should proactively encourage the adoption of statistical designs that would allow more patients to be treated at near-optimal doses while controlling for excessive toxicity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It can be difficult to explain pediatric phase 1 oncology trials to families of children with refractory cancer. Parents may misunderstand the information presented to them, and physicians may assume that certain topics are covered in the informed consent document and need not be discussed. Communication models can help to ensure effective discussions.
METHODS: Suggestions for improving the informed consent process were first solicited from phase 1 study clinicians via questionnaire. Eight parents who had enrolled their child on a phase 1 pediatric oncology trial were recruited for an advisory group designed to assess the clinicians' suggestions and make additional recommendations for improving informed consent for pediatric phase 1 trials.
RESULTS: A phase 1 communication model was designed to incorporate the suggestions of clinicians and families. It focused on educating parents/families about phase 1 trials at specific time points during a child's illness, but specifically at the point of disease recurrence. An informative phase 1 fact sheet that can be distributed to families was also presented.
CONCLUSIONS: Families who will be offered information regarding phase 1 clinical trials can first receive a standardized fact sheet explaining the general purpose of these early-phase clinical trials. Parental understanding may be enhanced further when oncologists address key themes, beginning at the time of diagnosis and continuing through important decision points during the child's illness. This model should be prospectively evaluated.},

What are some ethical safeguards for Phase 1 oncology research? A comparative review of literature contributed to the consolidation of the proposed ethical framework for Phase 1 oncology trials. This framework gives a special attention to issues of therapeutic misconception and vulnerability. The benefits and dangers associated with the enrollment in trials are described as well as the absence of alternatives, treatment-specific optimism, and vagueness in factual presentation during the informed consent process. The notion of therapeutic misconception is contrasted with optimism despite realism that stems from psychological, cultural, and religious factors and not necessarily from the lack of information. Close attention is given to the possible ways in which the inherent uncertainty and resulting cognitive biases may affect the informed consent process and the definition of therapeutic misconception. The article ends with recommendations for an ethical way of enrolling palliative patients in early stages of oncology research, giving special attention to provision of adequate consent, protection of vulnerability, and avoidance of therapeutic misconception.},

This paper presents the results of a simulation study in which one assigns more than one subject at a time to each dose level, and each dose increase is limited to one level. We show that these modifications address all of the most serious criticisms of the CRM, reducing the duration of the trial by 50-67 per cent, reducing toxicity incidence by 20-35 per cent, and lowering toxicity severity. These are achieved with minimal effects on accuracy. Most important, based on our experience at our institution, such modifications make the CRM acceptable to clinical investigators.},

	abstract = {Since our original proposal 4 years ago, considerable support has evolved for the concept of pharmacologically guided dose escalation in phase I clinical trials with new anticancer drugs. The original focus has been broadened to develop additional links between preclinical testing and phase I clinical trials. Recent experiences with very lengthy phase I trials for at least eight drugs have provided particular impetus for this project. The original pharmacodynamic hypothesis for the proposal was equal toxicity at equal plasma levels. Specifically, two facets of the concept were that (a) dose-limiting toxicity correlates with, and in turn is predicted by, drug concentrations in plasma and (b) that the quantitative relationship between toxicity and drug exposure, as measured by plasma drug concentration times time (C x T), holds across species. If true, this hypothesis would suggest that dose escalations in humans could be safely based on measurement of drug levels in plasma, rather than on empirical escalation schemes. In addition to the collection of a larger retrospective data base to validate this hypothesis, practical results have already been achieved. In two studies sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the escalation pattern was prospectively modified on the basis of measurements of drug levels in plasma. In addition, for three NCI-sponsored drugs, more careful matching of schedules between clinical and preclinical testing produced entry doses that were up to 25 times higher than doses used in standard procedures. Consequently, the phase I trials for each drug were completed with a savings of 12-24 months. As a result of work in both the United States and Europe, a substantial collection of data now demonstrates that coordination with preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies can save both time and resources in early clinical trials without a loss of safety.},

At the heart of the controversy is the question of whether risks of administering experimental drugs are therapeutically justified. We suggest that prior attempts to address this question have been muddled, in part because it cannot be answered adequately without first attending to the way labor is divided in managing risk in clinical trials. In what follows, we approach the question of therapeutic justification for phase 1 trials from the viewpoint of five different stakeholders: the drug regulatory authority, the IRB, the clinical investigator, the referring physician, and the patient. Our analysis shows that the question of therapeutic justification actually raises multiple questions corresponding to the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders involved. By attending to these contextual differences, we provide more coherent guidance for the ethical negotiation of risk in phase 1 trials involving patients. We close by discussing the implications of our argument for various perennial controversies in phase 1 trial practice.},

OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to establish the influence of blood alcohol concentration as a function of the complexity of the scenarios. Road scenarios implying automatic or controlled driving performances were manipulated in order to identify which behavioral parameters were deteriorated.
METHOD: A single blind counterbalanced experiment was conducted on a driving simulator. Sixteen experienced drivers (25.3 ± 2.9 years old, 8 men and 8 women) were tested with 0, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 g/l of alcohol. Driving scenarios varied: road tracking, car following, and an urban scenario including events inspired by real accidents. Statistical analyses were performed on driving parameters as a function of alcohol level.
RESULTS: Automated driving parameters such as standard deviation of lateral position measured with the road tracking and car following scenarios were impaired by alcohol, notably with the highest dose. More controlled parameters such as response time to braking and number of crashes when confronted with specific events (urban scenario) were less affected by the alcohol level.
CONCLUSION: Performance decrement was greater with driving scenarios involving automated processes than with scenarios involving controlled processes.},

The purpose of this study was to explore the difficult ethical problems related to patient information and motives for participation in such trials.
METHOD: A descriptive and explorative qualitative design was used. Fourteen cancer patients from three different phase 1 trials in end-stage cancer were interviewed. The interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: The patients expressed unrealistic expectations of therapeutic benefit and inadequate understanding of the trials' purpose, so-called therapeutic misconception. However, they reported a positive attitude towards participation. Thus, the patients valued the close and unique medical and psychological attention they received by participating. Participation also made them feel unique and notable.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with end-stage cancer participating in phase 1 clinical trials are unaware of the very small potential for treatment benefit and the risk of harm. Trial participation may offer hope and social-emotional support and a strategy for coping with the emotional stress associated with advanced cancer and may, consequently, improve emotional well-being.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ethicists have suggested that written consent forms encourage participants in phase 1 cancer trials to expect benefit from the experimental agent and to overlook serious risks.
METHODS: To evaluate the written description of direct benefit as well as risk, all consent forms for 1999 phase 1 cancer trials were compiled from 80 percent of the National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers and from six of eight large pharmaceutical developers of anticancer drugs. In each case, we evaluated the characteristics of the trial, the descriptions of the purpose and procedures of the research, the promise of benefit, the description of risks, and the description of alternatives.
RESULTS: Of 272 forms, 268 explicitly mentioned that the trial was research, and 249 stated that the purpose of the trial was testing for safety. Nearly all forms (269) mentioned the right to withdraw from the trial. Almost all forms (260) referred to the experimental agent as "treatment" or "therapy." Only one consent form promised direct benefit to subjects. Most forms (181) mentioned death as a risk, and very few (14) mentioned cure as even a possible benefit. Most (229) stated that there was unknown risk involved and indicated that severe or permanent harms were possible (224).
CONCLUSIONS: Consent forms for phase 1 oncology studies almost never promise direct benefit to subjects, rarely mention cure, and usually communicate the seriousness and unpredictability of risk. Although there is room for improvement, the substance of these forms is unlikely to be the primary source of misunderstanding by subjects in phase 1 oncology trials.},

	abstract = {Evolution of cancer therapy
The standard approach to treating cancer is giving patients the maximum tolerated amount of chemotherapy with the goal of doing the maximum possible damage to the tumor without killing the patient. This method is relatively effective, but it also causes major toxicities. Now, Enriquez-Navas et al. have demonstrated a different approach for ensuring efficacy of chemotherapy and minimizing toxicity. The authors used an evolutionary approach, where the dose of chemotherapy is guided by the tumor’s response to the previous dose, allowing a gradual withdrawal of the drug if the tumor continues to respond. This method proved quite effective for paclitaxel treatment in two different mouse models and warrants further evaluation in additional models as well as human trials.
Conventional cancer treatment strategies assume that maximum patient benefit is achieved through maximum killing of tumor cells. However, by eliminating the therapy-sensitive population, this strategy accelerates emergence of resistant clones that proliferate unopposed by competitors—an evolutionary phenomenon termed “competitive release.” We present an evolution-guided treatment strategy designed to maintain a stable population of chemosensitive cells that limit proliferation of resistant clones by exploiting the fitness cost of the resistant phenotype. We treated MDA-MB-231/luc triple-negative and MCF7 estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) breast cancers growing orthotopically in a mouse mammary fat pad with paclitaxel, using algorithms linked to tumor response monitored by magnetic resonance imaging. We found that initial control required more intensive therapy with regular application of drug to deflect the exponential tumor growth curve onto a plateau. Dose-skipping algorithms during this phase were less successful than variable dosing algorithms. However, once initial tumor control was achieved, it was maintained with progressively smaller drug doses. In 60 to 80\% of animals, continued decline in tumor size permitted intervals as long as several weeks in which no treatment was necessary. Magnetic resonance images and histological analysis of tumors controlled by adaptive therapy demonstrated increased vascular density and less necrosis, suggesting that vascular normalization resulting from enforced stabilization of tumor volume may contribute to ongoing tumor control with lower drug doses. Our study demonstrates that an evolution-based therapeutic strategy using an available chemotherapeutic drug and conventional clinical imaging can prolong the progression-free survival in different preclinical models of breast cancer.
Using evolutionary principles to guide drug administration, monotherapy with paclitaxel can maintain prolonged stability of breast cancer in preclinical models.

Unfortunately, all patients treated with these drugs will acquire resistance, most commonly as a result of a secondary mutation within EGFR (T790M). Because both drugs were developed to target wild-type EGFR, we hypothesized that current dosing schedules were not optimized for mutant EGFR or to prevent resistance. To investigate this further, we developed isogenic TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant pairs of cell lines that mimic the behavior of human tumors. We determined that the drug-sensitive and drug-resistant EGFR-mutant cells exhibited differential growth kinetics, with the drug-resistant cells showing slower growth. We incorporated these data into evolutionary mathematical cancer models with constraints derived from clinical data sets. This modeling predicted alternative therapeutic strategies that could prolong the clinical benefit of TKIs against EGFR-mutant NSCLCs by delaying the development of resistance.
Predictive models of EGFR-mutant tumor behavior point to alternative drug dosing strategies to prevent and treat acquired resistance.

	abstract = {In Phase I clinical trials, the algorithm-based dose-finding methods, such as the 3 + 3 and up-and-down designs, do not impose any dose-toxicity curve. In contrast, model-based designs, such as the continual reassessment method (CRM), assume a parametric model to borrow information from all the doses under consideration. For these conventional dose-finding methods, toxicity outcomes need to be observed shortly after the treatment, so that newly enrolled patients can be treated without delay. However, in the case of late-onset toxicity, patients’ outcomes may not be observed quickly enough to keep up with the speed of enrollment, and thus toxicity data may not be available when that information is needed. Patients who have not experienced toxicity by the decision-making time may yet experience toxicity later during the rest of the follow-up. Ignoring such late-onset toxicity information may lead to biased estimation of the dose toxicity probabilities and thus compromise the trial's performance. To expand the applicability of the 3 + 3, up-and-down, and CRM designs with late-onset toxicity, we propose to redistribute the mass of the censored observation to the right and utilize the fractional contribution for the unobserved toxicity outcome. We evaluate the operating characteristics of the proposed fractional designs through extensive simulation studies. The fractional designs satisfactorily resolve the issues associated with late-onset toxicity, and are compared favorably with other available methods.},

With conventional chemotherapy, efficacy is generally deemed to be dose-dependent, but the same may not be applicable to molecularly targeted agents (MTAs). We analysed consecutive patients included in Phase-I trials at the Royal Marsden Hospital from 5 January 2005 to 6 June 2006. We considered only trials of monotherapy MTAs in which the MTD was defined. Three patient cohorts (A, B, and C) were identified according to the dose received as a percentage of the final trial MTD (0–33\%, 34–65\%, {\textgreater}66\%). Potential efficacy was assessed using the non-progression rate (NPR), that is, complete/partial response or stable disease for at least 3 months by RECIST. A total of 135 patients having progressive disease before enrolment were analysed from 15 eligible trials. Median age was 57 years (20–86); male : female ratio was 1.8 : 1. Cohort A, B, and C included 28 (21\%), 22 (16\%), and 85 (63\%) patients; NPR at 3 and 6 months was 21\% and 11\% (A), 50\% and 27\% (B), 31\% and 14\% (C), respectively, P=0.9. Median duration of non-progression (17 weeks; 95\% CI=13–22) was not correlated with the MTD level, P=0.9.

	abstract = {A desirable property of any dose-escalation strategy for phase I oncology trials is coherence: if the previous patient experienced a toxicity, a higher dose is not recommended for the next patient; similarly, if the previous patient did not experience a toxicity, a lower dose is not recommended for the next patient. The escalation with overdose control (EWOC) approach is a model-based design that has been applied in practice, under which the dose assigned to the next patient is the one that, given all available data, has a posterior probability of exceeding the maximum tolerated dose equal to a pre-specified value known as the feasibility bound. Several methodological and applied publications have considered the EWOC approach with both feasibility bounds fixed and increasing throughout the trial. Whilst the EWOC approach with fixed feasibility bound has been proven to be coherent, some proposed methods of increasing the feasibility bound regardless of toxicity outcomes of patients can lead to incoherent dose-escalation. This paper formalises a proof that incoherent dose-escalation can occur if the feasibility bound is increased without consideration of preceding toxicity outcomes, and shows via simulation studies that only small increases in the feasibility bound are required for incoherent dose-escalations to occur.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To safely assess new drugs, cancer patients in initial cohorts of phase I oncology studies receive low drug doses. Doses are successively increased until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Because traditional chemotherapy is often more effective near the MTD, ethical concerns have been raised about administration of low drug doses to phase I patients. However, a substantial portion of oncology trials now investigate targeted agents, which may have different dose-response relationships than cytotoxic chemotherapies.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-four consecutive trials treating 683 patients between October 1, 2004, and June 30, 2008, at MD Anderson Cancer Center were analyzed. Patients were assigned to a low-dose ({\textless}or=25\% MTD), medium-dose (25-75\% MTD), or high-dose ({\textgreater}or=75\% MTD) group, and groups were compared for response rate, time-to-treatment failure, progression-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity. To remove negatively biasing data from the high-dose group, in a second analysis, patients treated above the MTD were excluded (high-dose group, 75-100\% MTD). Of the 683 patients, 97.7\% received targeted agents.
RESULTS: Even when excluding patients above the MTD, there was an early trend favoring the low- versus high-dose group in time-to-treatment failure, with 32.9\% versus 25.2\% of patients on therapy at 3 months (P = 0.08). In addition, the low-dose group fared at least as well as the other groups in all other outcomes, including response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity.
CONCLUSIONS: These data may help alleviate concerns that patients who receive low drug doses on contemporary phase I oncology trials fare worse and suggest targeted agents may have different dose-response relationships than cytotoxic chemotherapies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of alcohol on the cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMPs and oVEMPs). As alcohol produces gaze-evoked nystagmus (GEN), we also tested the effect of nystagmus independent of alcohol by recording oVEMPs during optokinetic stimulation (OKS).
METHODS: The effect of alcohol was tested in 14 subjects over multiple rounds of alcohol consumption up to a maximum breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) of 1.5‰ (mean 0.97‰). The effect of OKS was tested in 11 subjects at 5, 10 and 15deg/sec.
RESULTS: oVEMP amplitude decreased from baseline to the highest BrAC level by 27\% (range 5-50\%, P{\textless}0.001), but there was no significant effect on oVEMP latency or cVEMP amplitude or latency. There was a significant negative effect of OKS on oVEMP amplitude (16\%, P=0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: We found a selective effect of alcohol on oVEMP amplitude, but no effect on the cVEMP. Vertical nystagmus elicited by OKS reduced oVEMP amplitude.
SIGNIFICANCE: Alcohol selectively affects oVEMP amplitude. Despite the effects of alcohol and nystagmus, both reflexes were reliably recorded in all subjects and conditions. An absent response in a patient affected by alcohol or nystagmus indicates a vestibular deficit.},

Such early human studies confront a series of methodological and ethical challenges. In what follows, I propose a theoretical framework for early human studies aimed at informing the negotiation of these challenges. At the outset of clinical development, researchers confront a virtually undifferentiated landscape of uncertainty with respect to three variables: outcomes, their probability of occurrence, and operation dimensions needed to effectuate favorable outcomes. Early human trials transform this uncertain landscape into one where there are grounds for belief about risk and benefit for various combined operation dimensions. To accomplish this, studies set out with two aims. First, they identify a set of operation dimensions that, when combined as a package (intervention ensemble), elicits a reasonable probability of a target outcome. Second, they define the boundaries of dimension values within an intervention ensemble. This latter aim entails exposing at least some volunteers in early studies to treatments that are inactive or excessive. I provide examples that illustrate the way early human studies discover and delimit intervention ensembles, and close by offering some implications of this framework for ethics, methodology, and efficiency in clinical development of new interventions.},

RESULTS: 41 patients were treated; 34 received AZD0424 once-daily at doses ranging from 5 mg to 150 mg, and 7 received 40 mg bi-daily 41.5\% of patients experienced at least one AZD0424-related adverse event that was Grade 3-5 in severity, with patients treated at doses above 60 mg per day experiencing multiple treatment-related toxicities. The most commonly observed AZD0424-related adverse events were nausea, fatigue, anorexia and alopecia. Cmax and AUC increased linearly with dose and the mean±standard deviation t1/2 was 8.4±2.8 h. Clear evidence of Src target inhibition was seen at doses ⩾20 mg per day. No responses were observed and 7 patients (17.1\%) achieved stable disease lasting 6 weeks or more.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine if intra-patient dose escalation of the multi-targeted kinase inhibitor sorafenib is feasible in patients with advanced pretreated solid malignancies.
METHODS: An intra-patient dose escalation scheme starting at 400 mg BID was employed in this prospective trial. Doses were escalated to 600 mg BID for the second cycle and to 800 mg BID for the third cycle in the absence of grade 3+ adverse events. In the event of grade 3+ adverse events during cycle 1, doses were reduced to 400 mg daily through cycle 2. Dose re-escalation for cycle 3 was allowed in the absence of grade 3+ adverse events during cycle 2. Further dose escalation was prohibited. The primary endpoint was the overall percentage of patients tolerating dose escalation to 600 mg BID through cycle 2 or tolerating re-escalation to 400 mg BID through cycle 3.
RESULTS: Fifty eligible patients with various solid tumors and a median of 3 prior therapies were enrolled. Eleven patients (22\%) tolerated primary dose escalation or re-escalation. Only 14 patients (28\%) completed cycle 1 without dose modification or discontinuing treatment. Seven of 13 patients tolerated primary dose escalation through cycle 2. Four of 5 patients tolerated dose re-escalation through cycle 3. Reasons for escalation failure included tumor progression (42\%) and adverse events (26\%). Common grade 3+ adverse events included hand-foot skin reaction, hypertension, and hypophosphatemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Intra-patient dose escalation and/or re-escalation of sorafenib were not feasible in pretreated solid tumor patients. Sorafenib dose escalation remains an investigational approach.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ethical concerns about phase 1 trials persist. Important conceptual advances have been made in understanding concepts used to describe misunderstanding. However, a systematic, empirical evaluation of the frequency of misunderstanding incorporating recent developments is lacking.
METHODS: The authors queried 95 participants in phase 1 trials to provide a more sophisticated estimate of the proportion who had therapeutic misconception (TM), defined as misunderstanding the research purpose or how research differs from individualized care, and therapeutic misestimation (TMis), defined as incorrectly estimating the chance of a research trial benefit as {\textgreater}20\% or underestimating risk as 0\%.
RESULTS: Sixty-five of 95 respondents (68.4\%) had TM, which was associated in a multivariate analysis with lower education and family income (P = .008 and P = .001, respectively), but TM was not associated with the vulnerability of having hardly any treatment options. Eighty-nine of 95 respondents (94\%) had TMis, although only 18\% reported this was a factual estimate. Although the risks of investigational agents and those exacerbated by research, such as uncertain outcomes, were mentioned (39\% and 41\% of respondents, respectively), risks novel to research, such as research biopsies, were rarely mentioned (3\% of respondents). Although most of these respondents believed that their chance of benefit was greater and that their risk was lower than the population chance (optimists) (54.6\%), a substantial minority of respondents (37.6\%) were pessimists.
CONCLUSIONS: TM continues to be prevalent. Estimates of personal benefit were not usually meant to report facts, it remains unknown whether respondents in the current study had TMis. Although they are not more vulnerable, phase 1 participants need improved understanding of key TM concepts, with attention to risks that are not present in standard of care.},

	abstract = {Failure in cancer drug development exacts heavy burdens on patients and research systems. To investigate inefficiencies and burdens in targeted drug development in cancer, we conducted a systematic review of all prelicensure trials for the anticancer drug, sorafenib (Bayer/Onyx Pharmaceuticals). We searched Embase and MEDLINE databases on October 14, 2014, for prelicensure clinical trials testing sorafenib against cancers. We measured risk by serious adverse event rates, benefit by objective response rates and survival, and trial success by prespecified primary endpoint attainment with acceptable toxicity. The first two clinically useful applications of sorafenib were discovered in the first 2 efficacy trials, after five drug-related deaths (4.6\% of 108 total) and 93 total patient-years of involvement (2.4\% of 3,928 total). Thereafter, sorafenib was tested in 26 indications and 67 drug combinations, leading to one additional licensure. Drug developers tested 5 indications in over 5 trials each, comprising 56 drug-related deaths (51.8\% of 108 total) and 1,155 patient-years (29.4\% of 3,928 total) of burden in unsuccessful attempts to discover utility against these malignancies. Overall, 32 Phase II trials (26\% of Phase II activity) were duplicative, lacked appropriate follow-up, or were uninformative because of accrual failure, constituting 1,773 patients (15.6\% of 11,355 total) participating in prelicensure sorafenib trials. The clinical utility of sorafenib was established early in development, with low burden on patients and resources. However, these early successes were followed by rapid and exhaustive testing against various malignancies and combination regimens, leading to excess patient burden. Our evaluation of sorafenib development suggests many opportunities for reducing costs and unnecessary patient burden in cancer drug development.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ethical evaluation of risk-benefit in clinical trials is premised on the achievability of resolving research questions motivating an investigation.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the fraction and number of patients enrolled in trials that were at risk of not meaningfully addressing their primary research objective due to unsuccessful patient accrual.
METHODS: We used the National Library of Medicine clinical trial registry to capture all initiated phases 2 and 3 intervention clinical trials that were registered as closed in 2011. We then determined the number that had been terminated due to unsuccessful accrual and the number that had closed after less than 85\% of the target number of human subjects had been enrolled. Five factors were tested for association with unsuccessful accrual.
RESULTS: Of 2579 eligible trials, 481 (19\%) either terminated for failed accrual or completed with less than 85\% expected enrolment, seriously compromising their statistical power. Factors associated with unsuccessful accrual included greater number of eligibility criteria (p = 0.013), non-industry funding (25\% vs 16\%, p {\textless} 0.0001), earlier trial phase (23\% vs 16\%, p {\textless} 0.0001), fewer number of research sites at trial completion (p {\textless} 0.0001) and at registration (p {\textless} 0.0001), and an active (non-placebo) comparator (23\% vs 16\%, p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSION: A total of 48,027 patients had enrolled in trials closed in 2011 who were unable to answer the primary research question meaningfully. Ethics bodies, investigators, and data monitoring committees should carefully scrutinize trial design, recruitment plans, and feasibility of achieving accrual targets when designing and reviewing trials, monitor accrual once initiated, and take corrective action when accrual is lagging.},

The design and analysis of these trials have changed over the last years and, in particular, it is now rare for a Phase I study to not include one or more dose-expansion cohorts (DEC). It is common to see DEC involving several hundred patients, building on an initial dose escalation study that may have no {\textgreater}20 to 30 patients. There has been recent focus by researchers on the design of DEC and the analysis of DEC data. It is reasonable to explicitly account for the uncertainty in the estimation of the MTD, the dose upon which the whole of the DEC is currently based. In this paper, we focus on the dose escalation phase prior to the DEC, with the purpose of adapting it to the needs of DEC. Specifically, before beginning the DEC phase, we need to identify those dose levels that will be taken into the DEC. We define a useful concept for this purpose, the co-MTD, and the results support that the estimated MTD and co-MTD contain the true MTD with high probability. We also provide stopping rules for when the data support that the dose escalation can end and the dose expansion can begin. Simulated trials support the use of the proposed approach and provide additional information on how this approach compares with current practice.},

The design of phase I oncology trials has evolved rapidly over time and today includes more targeted agents and combinations of experimental drugs with standard drugs, which may further complicate how patients understand phase I research participation.Methods:We conducted semistructured interviews regarding motivations, decision making, and understanding of trial purpose nested within a phase I clinical trial of a novel PI3kinase inhibitor combined with a standard oral chemotherapy in 18 participants.Results:Fewer than half of patients correctly identified the safety and dosing objectives. The inclusion of a targeted agent was attractive to participants and was perceived as an indicator of less toxic or more efficacious therapy, with less appreciation for added risks. The significance of a cellular drug target, without a known predictive biomarker of response, was unclear to patients. The inclusion of a standard drug in the regimen attracted patients with more treatment options than traditional first-in-human participants. Patients frequently expressed a realistic understanding of prognosis and uncertainty of benefit, but simultaneous hopes for extraordinary outcomes.Conclusion:Novel phase I oncology trial designs may attract patients with less constrained treatment options, but the inclusion of targeted drugs and combinations including standard chemotherapies is likely to complicate understanding of safety and dosing objectives and likelihood of personal benefit for purposes of informed consent.},

The biphasic dose-response signature of hormesis is a common result of experiments in the field of toxicology, but the low-dose data have been largely ignored, and the prevailing view is that it is important to reduce levels of toxins as much as possible. However, in many cases, the “toxins” actually have essential or beneficial effects in low amounts. Prominent examples of such beneficial “toxins” are trace metals such as selenium, chromium, and zinc. Fundamental inter- and intracellular signals also exhibit hormetic dose responses, including hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, calcium, and protein kinases. Moreover, everyday health-promoting lifestyle factors, including exercise and dietary energy restriction, act, at least in part, through hormetic mechanisms involving activation of adaptive cellular stress response pathways (ACSRPs). ACSRPs typically involve receptors coupled to kinases and activation of transcription factors that induce the expression of cytoprotective proteins such as antioxidant enzymes, protein chaperones, and growth factors. The recognition and experimental utilization of hormesis is leading to novel approaches for preventing and treating a range of diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders.},

The error was the byproduct of the conflict between homeopathy and traditional medicine. To deny support to homeopathy, leaders of the biomedical community rejected the hormetic biphasic dose-response model, the proposed explanatory principle of homeopathy. The threshold dose-response model was adopted as an alternative model, quickly becoming central to toxicology/pharmacology and their numerous applications. Despite its near-universal acceptance, no attempt was made to validate the ability of the threshold model to accurately predict responses in the below-threshold zone at the time of acceptance and throughout the 20th century. In contrast, the hormetic biphasic dose-response model became marginalized and was excluded from the mainstream of pharmacological/toxicological teaching and practice, textbook development, professional society journal publications, annual meeting presentations, grant funding, and use in government risk assessment. Over the last decade there has been a resurgence of interest in hormesis due to findings indicating that hormetic responses are common, reproducible, and generalizable, as well as independent of biological model, endpoint, and chemical class/physical stressor. Large-scale studies have indicated that the threshold model fails to accurately predict responses below the threshold, whereas the hormetic dose-response model performs very well. These findings indicate that the biomedical community made an error on the nature of the dose-response relationship, compromising the accuracy of toxicological and risk assessment practices, including environmental exposure standards, and impeding drug discovery/development and drug safety studies.},

The ability of organisms to respond adaptively to low levels of exposure to environmental hazards in a manner that increases their resistance to more severe similar or different hazards is fundamental to the evolutionary process. The organisms that survive and reproduce are those best able to tolerate or avoid environmental hazards while competing successfully for limited energy (food) resources. Therefore many of the genes selected for their survival value encode proteins that protect cells against stress (heat-shock proteins, antioxidant enzymes, antiapoptotic proteins, etc.) or that mediate behavioral responses to environmental stressors (neurotransmitters, hormones, muscle cell growth factors, etc.). Examples of environmental conditions that can, at subtoxic levels, activate hormetic responses and examples of the genes and cellular and molecular pathways that mediate such adaptive stress responses are provided to illustrate how hormesis mediates natural selection.},

	abstract = {Hormesis is the beneficial adaptive response of cells and organisms to acute subtoxic doses of certain types of environmental stressors (e.g., heat, oxidation, environmental toxins). Repetitive hormesis through routine exercise, calorie restriction, or ingestion of low levels of phytotoxins with the diet can stimulate cellular catabolic turnover of damaged molecules and increase protective mechanisms. The net result is an improved ability of the organism to better cope with noxious insults (i.e., preconditioning). Key to the benefits of hormesis are (1) the intensity of the stress/toxin, which needs to be enough to stimulate an effective response without causing permanent damage (i.e., subtoxic) and (2) the duration of the exposure, which needs to be limited (acute) to allow repair and recovery. Fundamental to the hormetic adaptive response is gene expression regulation. Although different stressors elicit unique signature responses, the comparison of prototypical hormetic inducers has highlighted the role played by a few transcription factor families. The periodic pulsatile activation of Nrf2, NF-κB, HSF, and FOXO has been found to be essential to obtaining the beneficial effects of various hormetic stimuli in different biological models. This chapter discusses molecular mechanisms and gene targets for these transcription factor families in the hormetic adaptive context.},

The GPCR system has adapted to perceive almost all forms of environmental entities, for example, photons, odorants, lipids, carbohydrates, peptides, and nucleic acids. The GPCR system has also likely adapted to the presence of exogenous compounds that may at some doses be deleterious but at lower levels may indeed possess beneficial actions.

Whereas low- to moderate-intensity exercise exerts positive effects on the body, excessive exercise can be detrimental for somatic health. Here we review the evidence linking physical activity with cellular and functional modifications in different organ systems, with a focus on the dose-response characteristics of this relationship. Voluntary running and short-term treadmill running within the range of intensities normally experienced during voluntary running both enhance metabolism and preserve function across multiple organ systems. In contrast, running to exhaustion has a negative impact on global functioning. Overall, the effects of exercise clearly depend on the amount and intensity of activity. These effects conform to the biological principle of hormesis.},

	abstract = {The ability to adapt to varying levels of available energy in the form of food in the environment has allowed species to propagate and also thrive during times of energy surplus. However, in times when there is scant food available, similar evolutionary pressures have ensured that physiological systems can adapt to and utilize this food scarcity to their advantage. Considerable research has demonstrated that upon reduction of food intake, there are several beneficial effects upon cardiovascular, endocrinological, immune, and neuronal systems. Some of the effects of caloric restriction, however, tend to be exaggerated in many experimental cases due to biasing of overweight control subjects, yet reduction of total body weight still seems to engender beneficial effects for the individual. Some of the beneficial effects of caloric restriction are believed to arise from a reflexive response to the “stress” of reduced food intake. In conjunction with this is a similar hypothesis, known as “hormesis,” which proposes in a similar vein that other forms of stress, such as toxicological stress, can also engender a “protective” set of physiological responses that shields the individual from further stresses. This chapter discusses how these two theories of protective responses—caloric restriction and hormesis—share many overlapping properties.},

	abstract = {The impact of hormesis on health can be further appreciated by consideration of the “couch potato” lifestyle. When cells in the body and brain are not challenged, they become complacent and are therefore vulnerable to injury and disease. Lack of physical and mental exercise, in combination with excessive food intake, results in a condition called insulin resistance that is a harbinger of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, when fewer calories are consumed and when more energy is expended (exercise), cells are subjected to a mild metabolic stress. They respond to this mild stress adaptively by increasing their ability to take up glucose in respond to insulin. This hormesis response is, in part, responsible for the ability of dietary energy restriction and exercise to ward off diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, obesity and diabetes are not the only adverse physiological consequences of being a “couch potato.” Exercise and dietary energy restriction improve the functional efficiency of the heart and gut through a hormetic mechanism that involves increased activity of the parasympathetic component of the autonomic nervous system. As a consequence, heart rate and blood pressure are decreased and gut motility is increased, thereby reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and colon cancer. Relatively underappreciated is the contribution of the lack of mental challenges to the poor health associated with the couch potato lifestyle. Individuals who engage in intellectually challenging occupations or hobbies may be at reduced risk for Alzheimer’s disease because of the beneficial stress imposed on the neurons when they are challenged. Studies have shown that neurons respond to mental and physical activity by increasing their production of “neurotrophic factors” that may help them to resist disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.},

Detailed molecular mechanisms that bring about the hormetic effects are being increasingly understood and comprise a cascade of stress response and other pathways of maintenance and repair. Although the extent of immediate hormetic effects after exposure to a particular stress may only be moderate, the chain of events following initial hormesis leads to biologically amplified effects that are much larger, synergistic, and pleiotropic. A consequence of hormetic amplification is an increase in the homeodynamic space of a living system in terms of increased defense capacity and reduced load of damaged macromolecules. Hormetic strengthening of the homeodynamic space provides wider margins for metabolic fluctuation, stress tolerance, adaptation, and survival. Hormesis thus counterbalances the progressive shrinkage of the homeodynamic space that is the ultimate cause of aging, diseases, and death. Healthy aging may be achieved by hormesis through mild and periodic but not severe or chronic physical and mental challenges and by the use of nutritional hormesis incorporating mild stress-inducing molecules called hormetins.},

It shows that local pharmacies have been dispensing drugs based on hormesis for many decades. Among drugs that act via the hormetic dose response are those that combat anxiety and depression, make bones stronger, grow hair thicker, enhance cognitive function, and lessen pain. These drugs are some of the staples of the industry, permitting millions of people to live more normal and better lives. This chapter also shows that even when commonly used drugs such as antibiotics are administered to kill bacteria, they act hormetically at low doses and may be of concern because they can cause harmful bacterial colonies to grow. This is the case for antitumor drugs as well. Thus, the modern pharmacy is really a hormetic pharmacy, but this is really just the beginning. The currently unfolding future is one in which the biomedical and pharmaceutical giants will be developing so-called hormetic mimetics—drugs that can induce the normal adaptive pathways seen in the thousands of studies demonstrating hormesis but without exposing individuals to toxic doses of chemicals, ionizing radiation, extreme heat, or hard-to-maintain caloric restriction regimens. Screening chemicals based on their ability to activate, at subtoxic doses, specific adaptive cellular stress response pathways is a promising approach for drug development. The future pharmacy will be enhanced by research strategies and clinical practices that adopt hormetic principles and applications.},

	abstract = {Despite major strides in the treatment of cancer, the development of drug resistance remains a major hurdle. One strategy which has been proposed to address this is the sequential application of drug therapies where resistance to one drug induces sensitivity to another drug, a concept called collateral sensitivity. The optimal timing of drug switching in these situations, however, remains unknown. To study this, we developed a dynamical model of sequential therapy on heterogeneous tumors comprised of resistant and sensitive cells. A pair of drugs (Drug A, Drug B) are utilized and are periodically switched during therapy. Assuming resistant cells to one drug are collaterally sensitive to the opposing drug, we classified cancer cells into two groups, AR and BR, each of which is a subpopulation of cells resistant to the indicated drug and concurrently sensitive to the other, and we subsequently explored the resulting population dynamics. Specifically, based on a system of ordinary differential equations for AR and BR, we determined that the optimal treatment strategy consists of two stages: an initial stage in which a chosen effective drug is utilized until a specific time point, T, and a second stage in which drugs are switched repeatedly, during which each drug is used for a relative duration (i.e. fΔt-long for Drug A and (1 − f)Δt-long for Drug B with 0 ≤ f ≤ 1 and Δt ≥ 0). We prove that the optimal duration of the initial stage, in which the first drug is administered, T, is shorter than the period in which it remains effective in decreasing the total population, contrary to current clinical intuition. We further analyzed the relationship between population makeup, A/B = AR/BR, and the effect of each drug. We determine a critical ratio, which we term (A/B)*, at which the two drugs are equally effective. As the first stage of the optimal strategy is applied, A/B changes monotonically to (A/B)* and then, during the second stage, remains at (A/B)* thereafter. Beyond our analytic results, we explored an individual based stochastic model and presented the distribution of extinction times for the classes of solutions found. Taken together, our results suggest opportunities to improve therapy scheduling in clinical oncology.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To study the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral etoposide in patients with solid tumours.
METHODS: A prospective, open label, cross-over, bioavailability study was performed in 50 adult patients with miscellaneous, advanced stage solid tumours, who were receiving oral (100 mg capsules) etoposide for 14 days and i.v. (50 mg) etoposide on day 1 or day 7 in randomised order during the first cycle treatment. Total and unbound etoposide concentration were assayed by h.p.l.c. Population PK parameters estimation was done by using the P-Pharm software (Simed). Haematological toxicity and tumour response were the main pharmacodynamic endpoints.
RESULTS: Mean clearance was 1.14 l h(-1) (CV 25\%). Creatinine clearance was the only covariable to significantly reduce clearance variability (residual CV 18\%). (CL = 0.74 + 0.0057 CLCR; r(2) = 0.32). Mean bioavailability was 45\% (CV 22\%) and mean protein binding 91.5\% (CV 5\%). Exposure to free, pharmacologically active etoposide (free AUC p.o.) was highly variable (mean value 2.8 mg l(-1) h; CV 64\%; range 0.4-9.5). It decreased with increased creatinine clearance and increased with age which accounted for 9\% of the CV. Mean free AUC p.o. was the best predictor of neutropenia. Free AUC50 (exposure producing a 50\% reduction in absolute neutrophil count) was 1.80 mg l(-1) h. In patients with lung cancer, the free AUC p.o. was higher in the two patients with responsive tumour (5.9 mg l(-1) h) than in patients with stable (2.1 mg l-1 h) or progressive disease (2.3 mg l-1 h) (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to free etoposide during prolonged oral treatment is highly variable and is the main determinant of pharmacodynamic effects. The population PK model based on creatinine clearance is poorly predictive of exposure. Therapeutic drug monitoring would be necessary for dose individualization or to study the relationship between exposure and antitumour effect.},

Data were obtained from 190 patients who received the drug as a 30-min infusion (N=72) or orally (N=118). The population model was built with the use of NONMEM to identify candidate covariates, and obtain models for clearance (CL) and volume of distribution. The final models were based on first-order absorption with lag-time (oral data), and a two-compartment model with linear elimination from the central compartment. The Cockcroft–Gault creatinine clearance (CrCl) and WHO performance status (PS) were the only significant covariates: CL=(12.8+2.1 × CrCl) × (1−0.12 × PS). For the volume of distribution, a correlation was found between body weight and the central volume (V1)=0.58 × body weight. Based on the structural models, a limited-sampling strategy was developed with minor bias and good precision that can be applied a posteriori using timed samples obtained at 1.5, and 6 h after the administration of topotecan. In conclusion, a population pharmacokinetic model for topotecan has been developed that incorporates measures of renal function and PS to predict CL. In combination with drug monitoring, the limited sampling strategy allows individualised treatment for patients receiving oral topotecan.},

A total of 31 patients received 86 cycles of chemotherapy, 36 by standard dosing and 50 by adaptive control. However, there was no demonstrable advantage to the adaptive control scheme, because of apparent bias of the previous model.

	doi = {10.1007/s00280-005-0140-2},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: The aims of the study were (a) to characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK), including inter-individual variability (IIV) and inter-occasion variability (IOV) as well as covariate relationships and (b) to characterise the relationship between the PK and the haematological toxicity of the component drugs of the fluorouracil (5-FU)-epirubicin (EPI)-cyclophosphamide (CP) regimen in breast cancer patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 140 breast cancer patients, either within one of different studies or in routine clinical management, were included in the analyses. The patients were all treated with the fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (FEC) regimen every third week for 3-12 courses, either in standard doses, i.e. 600/60/600 mg/m(2) of 5-FU, EPI and CP, respectively, or according to a dose escalation/reduction protocol (tailored dosing). PK data were available from 84 of the patients, whereas time-courses of haematological toxicity were available from 87 patients. The data analysis was carried out using mixed effects models within the NONMEM program.
RESULTS: The PK of 5-FU, EPI and 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide (4-OHCP), the active metabolite of CP, were described with a one-compartment model with saturable elimination, a three-compartment linear model and a two-compartment linear model, respectively. No clinical significant correlation was found between PK across drugs. The unexplained variability in clearance was found to be less within patients, between courses (inter-occasion variability, IOV) than between patients (inter-individual variability, IIV) for EPI and 5-FU. For 4-OHCP, however, the IIV diminished by approximately 45\% when significant covariates were included and the final population model predicts an IIV that is equal to IOV. Significant covariates for elimination capacity parameters were serum albumin (5-FU, EPI and 4-OHCP), creatinine clearance (5-FU), bilirubin (EPI) and body surface area (BSA) (4-OHCP). Elimination capacity of 5-FU and EPI was not related to BSA and for none of the studied drugs did body weight explain the PK variability. The time-course of haematological toxicity after treatment was well described by a semi-physiological model that assumes additive haematological toxicity between CP and EPI with negligible contribution from 5-FU. The influence of G-CSF could be incorporated into the model in a mechanistic manner as shortening the maturation time to 43\% of the normal duration and increasing the mitotic activity to 269\% of normal activity.
CONCLUSIONS: The models presented describe the dose-concentration-toxicity relationships for the FEC therapy and may provide a basis for implementation and comparison of different individualisation strategies based on covariates, therapeutic drug monitoring and/or pharmacodynamic (PD) feedback. The PD model extends on previous semi-mechanistic models in that it also takes G-CSF administration into account.},

Patients and Methods Forty-four patients with advanced disease received EPI and DTX every 3 weeks for up to nine cycles. The initial doses (EPI/DTX) were 75/70 mg/m2. Based on leukocyte (WBC) and platelet counts, the subsequent doses were, stepwise, either escalated (maximum, 120/100 mg/m2) or reduced (minimum, 40/50 mg/m2). Hematologic toxicity was monitored in all patients, whereas pharmacokinetics was studied in 16 patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients with advanced disease received EPI and DTX every 3 weeks for up to nine cycles. The initial doses (EPI/DTX) were 75/70 mg/m(2). Based on leukocyte (WBC) and platelet counts, the subsequent doses were, stepwise, either escalated (maximum, 120/100 mg/m(2)) or reduced (minimum, 40/50 mg/m(2)). Hematologic toxicity was monitored in all patients, whereas pharmacokinetics was studied in 16 patients. A semiphysiological model, including physiological parameters as well as drug-specific parameters, was used to describe the time course of WBC count following treatment.

Paclitaxel (total and unbound) and CrEL concentrations were obtained according to a sparse sampling scheme with on average only 3.5 samples per course from 45 patients with solid tumours who received 3-hour infusions of paclitaxel (final dose range 112-233 mg/m(2)). The present data were predicted well by the mechanism-based model. In addition, bilirubin and body size were found to be significant as covariates. A change in body surface area (BSA) of 0.1 m(2) typically caused a change in clearance (CL) of 22.3 l/h and an increase in bilirubin of 10 microM typically caused a decrease in CL of 41 l/h. Toxicity was best described by a threshold model. In conclusion, even with a sparse sampling scheme, the same mechanism-based binding components as in the previously developed model could be identified.

	abstract = {The aim of a phase I oncology trial is to identify a dose with an acceptable safety profile. Most phase I designs use the dose-limiting toxicity, a binary endpoint, to assess the unacceptable level of toxicity. The dose-limiting toxicity might be incomplete for investigating molecularly targeted therapies as much useful toxicity information is discarded. In this work, we propose a quasi-continuous toxicity score, the total toxicity profile (TTP), to measure quantitatively and comprehensively the overall severity of multiple toxicities. We define the TTP as the Euclidean norm of the weights of toxicities experienced by a patient, where the weights reflect the relative clinical importance of each grade and toxicity type. We propose a dose-finding design, the quasi-likelihood continual reassessment method (CRM), incorporating the TTP score into the CRM, with a logistic model for the dose-toxicity relationship in a frequentist framework. Using simulations, we compared our design with three existing designs for quasi-continuous toxicity score (the Bayesian quasi-CRM with an empiric model and two nonparametric designs), all using the TTP score, under eight different scenarios. All designs using the TTP score to identify the recommended dose had good performance characteristics for most scenarios, with good overdosing control. For a sample size of 36, the percentage of correct selection for the quasi-likelihood CRM ranged from 80\% to 90\%, with similar results for the quasi-CRM design. These designs with TTP score present an appealing alternative to the conventional dose-finding designs, especially in the context of molecularly targeted agents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Toxicity grades underlie the definition of a dose-limiting toxicity but in the majority of phase I designs, the information contained in the individual grades is not used. Some authors have argued that it may be more appropriate to consider a polytomous rather than dichotomous response.
PURPOSE: We investigate whether the added information on individual grades can improve the operating characteristics of the continual reassessment method.
METHODS: We compare the original continual reassessment method design for a binary response with two stage continual reassessment method designs which make different use of lower grade toxicity information via simulations. Specifically, we study a two-stage design that utilizes lower grade toxicities in the first stage only, during the initial non-model-based escalation, and two-stage designs where lower grades are used throughout the trial via explicit models. We postulate a model relating the rates of lower grade toxicities to the rate of dose-limiting toxicity, or assume the relative rates of low-to-high grade toxicities is unknown. The designs were compared in terms of accuracy, patient allocation, and precision.
RESULTS: Significant gains can be achieved when using grades in the first stage of a two-stage design. Otherwise, only modest improvements are seen when the information on grades is exploited via the use of explicit models, where the parameters are known precisely. Continual reassessment method with some use of grade information, increases the number of patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose by approximately 5\%. The additional information from lower grades can lead to a small increase in the precision of our estimate of the maximum tolerated dose.
LIMITATIONS: Our comparisons are not exhaustive and it would be worth studying other models and situations.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the gains in performance were not as great as we had hoped, we observed no cases where the performance of continual reassessment method was poorer. Our recommendation is that investigators might consider using graded toxicities at the design stage.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The first human exposure to a new medicine always carries a major risk. Assessment of the safety profile and determination of a therapeutic dose are formidable tasks, particularly in oncology where toxicity is seen as a surrogate for efficacy. Increasing evidence supports the adoption of innovative dose-toxicity models, as these are safer and more efficient in meeting the challenges of modern investigational oncology than traditional models used in Phase I clinical trials.
AREAS COVERED: A literature review on dose-toxicity models in oncology was carried out. The objective of this study was to provide a non-mathematical, reader-friendly overview of current and innovative dose-toxicity models in oncology with an emphasis on recent clinical advances, including the benefits of a Bayesian framework.
EXPERT OPINION: Innovative dose-toxicity models attempt to minimize clinical risk and maximize research performance. Of these, the Bayesian Continual Reassessment Method and the Escalation With Overdose Control are two successful contemporary designs that outperformed traditional models in clinical trials; they account for patient heterogeneity, combination therapy, and they appropriately assess molecularly targeted agents. Support by regulatory authorities is providing an additional incentive to the widespread use of innovative and efficient dose-toxicity designs: this will improve investigational oncology, and ultimately benefit patients and science alike.},

METHODS: We retrieved all phase I trials testing monotherapy with an MTA published over the last decade. In each trial, all items used to define DLTs were recorded.
RESULTS: Reports of 155 phase I trials evaluating 111 different MTAs were reviewed. The most frequent determinant of whether a toxicity was regarded as a DLT was severity, usually assessed using the NCI CTCAE classification. However, for any given toxicity, there was substantial variability in the degree of severity required for a toxicity to be considered a DLT. Specifications about minimum duration of toxicity, degree of reversibility, the need to delay treatment and to reduce dose-intensity because of toxicity were infrequently incorporated in the definition of DLT. The definition of DLT varied with administration schedule. Discrepancies between the initial and the final definition of DLT were reported in 25\% of trials.
CONCLUSIONS: While our results do not support a standardisation of the definition of DLT, the inclusion of following specifications in its definition when relevant would reduce the heterogeneity observed across trials: (1) DLT assessment period, (2) absolute severity according to NCI CTCAE classification as well as severity relative to baseline status, (3) minimum duration of toxicity, (4) reversibility of toxicity within a certain period of time, and (5) necessity to delay treatment or to reduce dose-intensity.},

Four phase I studies have been finalized, with E7070 administered at four different treatment schedules to identify the maximum-tolerated dose and the dose-limiting toxicities. Pharmacokinetic analyses of all studies revealed E7070 to have nonlinear pharmacokinetics. A population pharmacokinetic model was designed and validated to describe the pharmacokinetics of E7070 at all four treatment schedules and to identify the possible influences of patient characteristics on the pharmacokinetic parameters.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma concentration-time data of all patients (n = 143) were fitted to several pharmacokinetic models using NONMEM. Seventeen covariables were investigated for their relation with individual pharmacokinetic parameters. A bootstrap procedure was performed to check the validity of the model.
RESULTS: The data were best described using a three-compartment model with nonlinear distribution to a peripheral compartment and two parallel pathways of elimination from the central compartment: a linear and a saturable pathway. Body-surface area (BSA) was significantly correlated to both the volume of distribution of the central compartment and to the maximal elimination capacity. The fits of 500 bootstrap replicates of the data set demonstrated the robustness of the developed population pharmacokinetic model.
CONCLUSION: A population pharmacokinetic model has been designed and validated that accurately describes the data of four phase I studies with E7070. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that BSA-guided dosing for E7070 is important.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Diflomotecan (BN80915) is an E-ring modified camptothecin analogue that possesses greater lactone stability in plasma compared with other topoisomerase I inhibitors, a potential advantage for antitumor activity. As with other camptothecins, oral administration has pharmacological and clinical advantages. This Phase I study was performed to assess the feasibility of the administration of oral diflomotecan, to determine the maximum-tolerated, dose its bioavailability, and to explore the pharmacokinetics.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: An initial i.v. bolus was administered to assess the bioavailability of diflomotecan. Fourteen days later, diflomotecan was administered p.o. once daily for 5 days to adult patients with solid malignant tumors and repeated every 3 weeks. BN80915 and its open lactone form BN80942 were measured.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients entered the study and received a total of 57 cycles of oral diflomotecan at flat dose levels of 0.10, 0.20, 0.27, and 0.35 mg. The main toxicity was hematological, but some patients experienced alopecia, mild gastrointestinal toxicity, and fatigue. At the 0.35-mg dose level, 2 of 4 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity comprising grade 3 thrombocytopenia with epistaxis and febrile neutropenia in 1 patient and uncomplicated grade 4 neutropenia lasting for {\textgreater}7 days in another. Toxicity was acceptable at the 0.27-mg dose level at which dose-limiting toxicities were observed in 3 of 12 patients (grade 4 neutropenia {\textgreater} 7 days, complicated by fever in 1 patient but without other signs of infection). After two cycles of diflomotecan, 6 patients had disease stabilization, which was maintained in 2 patients for 9 months and {\textgreater}1 year, respectively. Diflomotecan pharmacokinetics were linear over the dose range studied. Systemic exposure correlated with the fall in WBC counts. The mean oral bioavailability (+/-SD) was 72.24 +/- 59.2\% across all dose levels. Urinary excretion of BN80915 was very low.
CONCLUSIONS: The recommended oral diflomotecan dose for Phase II studies is 0.27 mg/day x 5 every 3 weeks. This regimen is convenient and generally well tolerated with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and high but variable bioavailability.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The phase I program of anticancer agents usually consists of multiple dose escalation studies to select a safe dose for various administration schedules. We hypothesized that pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling of an initial phase I study (stage 1) can be used for selection of an optimal starting dose for subsequent studies (stage 2) and that a post-hoc PK-PD analysis enhances the selection of a recommended dose for phase II evaluation. The aim of this analysis was to demonstrate that this two-stage model-based design, which does not interfere in the conduct of trials, is safe, efficient and effective.
METHODS: PK and PD data of dose escalation studies were simulated for nine compounds and for five administration regimens (stage 1) for drugs with neutropenia as dose-limiting toxicity. PK-PD models were developed for each simulated study and were used to determine a starting dose for additional phase I studies (stage 2). The model-based design was compared to a conventional study design regarding safety (number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)), efficiency (number of patients treated with a dose below the recommended dose) and effectiveness (precision of dose selection). Retrospective data of the investigational anticancer drug indisulam were used to show the applicability of the model-based design.
RESULTS: The model-based design was as safe as the conventional design (median number of DLTs = 3) and resulted in a reduction of the number of patients who were treated with a dose below the recommended dose (-27\%, power 89\%). A post-hoc model-based determination of the recommended dose for future phase II studies was more precise than the conventional selection of the recommended dose (root mean squared error 8.3\% versus 30\%).
CONCLUSIONS: A two-stage model-based phase I design is safe for anticancer agents with dose-limiting myelosuppression and may enhance the efficiency of dose escalation studies by reducing the number of patients treated with a dose below the recommended dose and by increasing the precision of dose selection for phase II evaluation.},

	abstract = {AIM: To investigate the potential of a model for chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression to predict the full time-course of myelosuppression in patients based on rat data.
METHODS: White blood cell counts were determined in rats after administration of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, paclitaxel or etoposide. Pharmacokinetic models were used to predict the concentration-time profile in each rat. A semi-physiological model of myelosuppression was applied to the rat data. The drug-related parameter Slope was allowed to differ between drugs. The analysis was performed in NONMEM VI. Time-courses of myelosuppression in patients were predicted for each drug based on patient pharmacokinetic models, typical system-related parameters previously determined in patients and the rat Slope estimates in the present study.
RESULTS: The semi-physiological model of myelosuppression fit the rat data well and the estimated maturation time in rats (53 h) was approximately half of the previous estimate in patients. The relative difference in Slope estimates for rats and patients based on total drug concentrations ranged between 28\% to 8-fold for the six drugs. The differences reduced to 8-37\% for all drugs when correcting the rat Slope estimates for species difference in protein binding and in CFU-GM assay sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: This method for interspecies scaling was successful in predicting the time-course of myelosuppression in patients based on rat data. Predictions improved when species differences in protein binding and CFU-GM assay sensitivity were accounted for. The approach appears promising for predicting myelosuppression in patients early in development.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00280-009-1089-3},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: A previously developed semi-physiological model of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression has shown consistent system-related parameter and inter-individual variability (IIV) estimates across drugs. A requirement for dose individualization to be useful is relatively low variability between treatment courses (inter-occasion variability [IOV]) in relation to IIV. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare magnitudes of IOV and IIV in myelosuppression model parameters across six different anti-cancer drug treatments.
METHODS: Neutrophil counts from several treatment courses following therapy with docetaxel, paclitaxel, epirubicin-docetaxel, 5-fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide, topotecan, and etoposide were included in the analysis. The myelosuppression model was fitted to the data using NONMEM VI. IOV in the model parameters baseline neutrophil counts (ANC0), mean transit time through the non-mitotic maturation chain (mean transit time [MTT]), and the parameter describing the concentration-effect relationship (slope), were evaluated for statistical significance (P {\textless} 0.001).
RESULTS: Inter-occasion variability in MTT was significant for all the investigated datasets, except for topotecan, and was of similar magnitude (8-16 CV\%). IOV in slope was significant for docetaxel, topotecan, and etoposide (19-39 CV\%). For all six investigated datasets, the IOV in myelosuppression parameters was lower than the IIV. There was no indication of systematic shifts in the system- or drug sensitivity-related parameters over time across datasets.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the semi-physiological model of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression has potential to be used for prediction of the time-course of myelosuppression in future courses and is, thereby, a valuable step towards individually tailored anticancer drug therapy.},

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: * The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ifosfamide and its main metabolites can both be modelled with no influence of infusion duration. * Pharmacodynamic modelling (renal and haematological toxicity) allows further simulations of new schedules with favourable toxicity profiles.
AIMS: To model the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ifosfamide and its key metabolites. The pharmacodynamic parameters included were renal toxicity and myelosuppression measured using urinary beta(2)-microglobulin (BMG) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC), respectively.
METHODS: Seventeen patients were enrolled into an n = 1 randomized trial during two consecutive cycles of ifosfamide 9 g m(-2) during each cycle given by a 3 h or 72 h infusion. Data were analyzed using NONMEM.
RESULTS: Ifosfamide and metabolite concentration-time profiles were described by a one-compartment open-model with auto-induction of clearance. BMG and ANC time-courses were related to ifosfamide concentration via indirect response models.
CONCLUSIONS: This modelling allowed the simulation of weekly schedules of flat doses with favourable myelotoxic profiles.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The objectives of these analyses were to (1) develop a semimechanistic-physiologic population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model to describe neutropenic response to pemetrexed and to (2) identify influential covariates with respect to pharmacodynamic response.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 279 patients who received 1,136 treatment cycles without folic acid or vitamin B12 supplementation during participation in one of eight phase II cancer trials were available for analysis. Starting doses were 500 or 600 mg pemetrexed per m2 body surface area (BSA), administered as 10-min intravenous infusions every 21 days (1 cycle). The primary analyses included 105 patients (279 cycles) for which selected covariates-including vitamin deficiency marker data (i.e., homocysteine, cystathionine, methylmalonic acid, and methylcitrate [I, II, and total] plasma concentrations)-were available. Classical statistical multivariate regression analyses and a semimechanistic-physiologic population PK/PD model were used to evaluate neutropenic response to single-agent pemetrexed administration.
RESULTS: The timecourse of neutropenia following single-agent pemetrexed administration was adequately described by a semimechanistic-physiologic model. Population estimates for system-based model parameters (i.e., baseline neutrophil count, mean transit time, and the feedback parameter), which mathematically represent current understanding of the process and physiology of hematopoiesis, were consistent with previously reported values. The population PK/PD model included homocysteine, cystathionine, albumin, total protein, and BSA as covariates relative to neutropenic response.
CONCLUSION: These results support the programmatic decision to introduce folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation during pemetrexed clinical development as a means of normalizing patient homocysteine levels, thereby managing the risk of severe neutropenia secondary to pemetrexed administration. The current results also suggest that the addition of vitamin B6 supplementation to normalize patient cystathionine levels may further decrease the incidence of grade 4 neutropenia following pemetrexed administration. The results also suggest the use of folic acid as a means of lessening hematologic toxicity following administration of cytotoxic agents other than antifolates.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The objective of these analyses was to examine the effect of variations in the explanatory factors of neutropenic response, identified by semimechanistic-physiologic population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling, on clinically important features of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC)-time profile (e.g, the nadir of the ANC [NANC], its timing [T (Nadir)], and the timecourse of recovery [T (Rec)]).
METHODS: Correlation analyses were used to evaluate the relationship of NANC, T (Nadir), and T (Rec) as a function of overall systemic exposure (AUC) and each of the covariates contained in the population PK/PD model. Simulations using the final PK/PD model were used to generate complete ANC-time profiles. Frequency counts of NANCs from the simulated profiles were used to quantitatively explore differences in the incidence and severity of neutropenia associated with a variety of scenarios (500 mg/m2 versus 600 mg/m2, normal vitamin deficiency markers versus elevated vitamin deficiency markers, and body surface area-based versus renal function-based dosing) and to evaluate the effect of individual explanatory factors with respect to neutropenic response.
RESULTS: Information obtained from correlation analysis and simulations was helpful in quantitatively exploring the impact of dose, exposure, and/or patient characteristics on neutropenic response. The information gained from these simulations provided supportive evidence for the decision to routinely include vitamin supplementation during pemetrexed treatment as a means of managing the risk of severe neutropenia secondary to pemetrexed administration. These techniques also provided information regarding the specific T (Nadir) and T( Rec) for inclusion in product labeling and suggested that a 14-day treatment cycle might be feasible for pemetrexed.
CONCLUSION: For population PK/PD models, to provide useful information for the practicing clinician or the clinical development team, it is not sufficient to look only at influences of covariates on model parameters. Rather, the modeling results need to be carefully investigated in terms of clinically relevant measures.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Continuous dose delivery in radiation therapy treatments has been shown to decrease total treatment time while improving the dose conformity and distribution homogeneity over the conventional step-and-shoot approach. The authors develop an inverse treatment planning method for Gamma Knife® Perfexion™ that continuously delivers dose along a path in the target.
METHODS: The authors' method is comprised of two steps: find a path within the target, then solve a mixed integer optimization model to find the optimal collimator configurations and durations along the selected path. Robotic path-finding techniques, specifically, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using an extended Kalman filter, are used to obtain a path that travels sufficiently close to selected isocentre locations. SLAM is novelly extended to explore a 3D, discrete environment, which is the target discretized into voxels. Further novel extensions are incorporated into the steering mechanism to account for target geometry.
RESULTS: The SLAM method was tested on seven clinical cases and compared to clinical, Hamiltonian path continuous delivery, and inverse step-and-shoot treatment plans. The SLAM approach improved dose metrics compared to the clinical plans and Hamiltonian path continuous delivery plans. Beam-on times improved over clinical plans, and had mixed performance compared to Hamiltonian path continuous plans. The SLAM method is also shown to be robust to path selection inaccuracies, isocentre selection, and dose distribution.
CONCLUSIONS: The SLAM method for continuous delivery provides decreased total treatment time and increased treatment quality compared to both clinical and inverse step-and-shoot plans, and outperforms existing path methods in treatment quality. It also accounts for uncertainty in treatment planning by accommodating inaccuracies.},

To achieve such an objective, the general framework of the neutropenia models was expanded, including one additional physiologic process resembling cell cycle dynamics. The main assumptions of the proposed model are as follows: within the stem cell compartment, proliferative and quiescent cells coexist, and only cells in the proliferative condition are sensitive to drug effects and capable of following the maturation chain. Cell cycle dynamics were characterized by two new parameters, FProl (the fraction of proliferative [Prol] cells that enters into the maturation chain) and kcycle (first-order rate constant governing cell cycle dynamics within the stem cell compartment). Both model parameters were identifiable as indicated by the results from a bootstrap analysis, and their estimates were supported by date from the literature. The estimates of FProl and kcycle were 0.58 and 1.94 day(-1), respectively. The new model could properly describe the neutropenic effects of diflomotecan after very different dosing scenarios, and can be used to explore the potential impact of dosing schedule dependencies on neutropenia prediction.},

An ability to predict the neutropenic effects of cytotoxic agents based on proposed trial designs and models conditioned on previous studies would be valuable. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of a semi-mechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model for myelosuppression to predict the neutropenia observed in Phase I clinical studies, based on parameter estimates obtained from prior trials. Pharmacokinetic and neutropenia data from 5 clinical trials for diflomotecan and from 4 clinical trials for indisulam were used. Data were analyzed and simulations were performed using the population approach with NONMEM VI. Parameter sets were estimated under the following scenarios: (a) data from each trial independently, (b) pooled data from all clinical trials and (c) pooled data from trials performed before the tested trial. Model performance in each of the scenarios was evaluated by means of predictive (visual and numerical) checks. The semi-mechanistic PK/PD model for neutropenia showed adequate predictive ability for both anti-cancer agents. For diflomotecan, similar predictions were obtained for the three scenarios. For indisulam predictions were better when based on data from the specific study, however when the model parameters were conditioned on data from trials performed prior to a specific study, similar predictions of the drug related-neutropenia profiles and descriptors were obtained as when all data were used. This work provides further indication that modeling and simulation tools can be applied in the early stages of drug development to optimize future trials.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the predictive value of early assessment (after one cycle of induction chemotherapy (IC)) with (18)F-FDG-PET/CT and DW-MRI for subsequent response to radical chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
METHODS: 20 patients with stage III-IVa HNSCC prospectively underwent (18)F-FDG-PET/CT and diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) before and 2 weeks following each cycle of IC (1st cycle - IC1, 2nd cycle - IC2). Response was assessed 3 months after completion of chemoradiotherapy with clinical examination, MRI and (18)F-FDG-PET/CT. Patients with persistent disease were classed as non-responders. Changes in functional and molecular imaging (FMI) parameters following IC1 were compared between responders and non-responders with Mann-Whitney U test. The significance threshold was set at P{\textless}0.05.
RESULTS: Responders showed a significantly greater reduction in metabolic tumour volume (MTV)(P = 0.03) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG)(P = 0.04) following IC1 than non-responders. Responders also showed a tendency towards a larger, but statistically non-significant increase in apparent diffusion coefficient following IC1. There was no significant difference in the changes from baseline between the IC1 and IC2 for all FMI parameters indicating that most biological response to IC measured by (18)F-FDG-PET/CT and DW-MRI was observed early after the first cycle of IC.
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data indicate that the (18)F-FDG-PET/CT-derived MTV or TLG, acquired after IC1 are early predictive biomarkers for ultimate response to subsequent chemoradiotherapy. This enables identification of patients at risk of treatment failure at an early time-point, permitting treatment individualisation and consideration of alternative strategies such as radiotherapy dose-escalation or surgery.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of epirubicin and paclitaxel in combination, as well as the effects of paclitaxel and its vehicle Cremophor EL on epirubicin metabolism.
METHODS: Twenty-seven female patients with metastatic breast cancer received epirubicin 90 mg m-2 i.v. followed 15 min or 30 h later by a 3 h i.v. infusion of paclitaxel 175, 200 and 225 mg m-2. Plasma concentrations of paclitaxel, epirubicin and epirubicinol were measured and the relationship between neutropenia and drug pharmacokinetics was evaluated using a sigmoid maximum effect (Emax) model. Finally, the influence of paclitaxel and Cremophor EL on epirubicin metabolism by whole blood was examined.
RESULTS: An increase in epirubicinol plasma concentrations occurred after the start of the paclitaxel infusion, resulting in a significant increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of epirubicinol (+0.5 micromol l-1 h [95\% CI for the difference: 0.29, 0.71],+0.66 micromol l-1 h [95\% CI for the difference: 0.47, 0.85] and +0.82 micromol l-1 h [95\% CI for the difference: 0.53, 1.11] at paclitaxel doses of 175, 200 and 225 mg m-2, respectively), compared with epirubicin followed by paclitaxel 30 h later (0.61+/-0.1 micromol l-1 h). A significant increase in epirubicin AUC (+0.74 micromol l-1 h [95\% CI for the difference: 0.14, 1.34] and +1.09 micromol l-1 h [95\% CI for the difference: 0.44, 1.74]) and decrease in drug clearance (CLTB) (-25.35 l h-1 m-2[95\% CI for the difference: -50.18, -0.52] and -35.9 l h-1 m-2[95\% CI for the difference -63,4,-8,36]) occurred in combination with paclitaxel 200 and 225 mg m-2 with respect to the AUC (3.16+/-0.6 micromol l-1 h) and CLTB (74.4+/-28.4 l h-1 m-2) of epirubicin followed by paclitaxel 30 h later. An Emax relationship was observed between neutropaenia and the time over which paclitaxel plasma concentrations were equal to or greater than 0.1 micromol l-1 (tC0.1). The tC0.1 value predicted to yield a 50\% decrease in neutrophil count was 7.7 h. Finally, Cremophor EL markedly inhibited the metabolism of epirubicin to epirubicinol in whole blood.
CONCLUSIONS: Paclitaxel/Cremophor EL affects the disposition of epirubicinol and epirubicin. Furthermore, the slope factor of the Emax relationship between neutropenia and tC0.1 of paclitaxel suggests that the drugs might also interact at the pharmacodynamic level.},

	abstract = {Gasparini and Eisele (2000, Biometrics 56, 609 615) present a development of the continual reassessment method of O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher (1990, Biometrics 46, 33-48). They call their development a curve-free method for Phase I clinical trials. However, unless we are dealing with informative prior information, then the curve-free method coincides with the usual model-based continual reassessment method. Both methods are subject to arbitrary specification parameters, and we provide some discussion on this. Whatever choices are made for one method, there exists equivalent choices for the other method, where " equivalent" means that the operating characteristics (sequential dose allocation and final recommendation) are the same. The insightful development of Gasparini and Eisele provides clarification on some of the basic ideas behind the continual reassessment method, particularly when viewed from a Bayesian perspective. But their development does not lead to a new class of designs and the comparative results in their article, indicating some preference for curve-free designs over model-based designs, are simply reflecting a more fortunate choice of arbitrary specification parameters. Other choices could equally well have inversed their conclusion. A correct conclusion should be one of operational equivalence. The story is different for the case of informative priors, a situation that is inherently much more difficult. We discuss this. We also mention the important idea of two-stage designs (Moller, 1995, Statistics in Medicine 14, 911-922; O'Quigley and Shen, 1996, Biometrics 52, 163-174), arguing, via a simple comparison with the results of Gasparini and Eisele (2000), that there is room for notable gains here. Two-stage designs also have an advantage of avoiding the issue of prior specification altogether.},

	abstract = {Consider the problem of finding the dose that is as high as possible subject to having a controlled rate of toxicity. The problem is commonplace in oncology Phase I clinical trials. Such a dose is often called the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) since it represents a necessary trade-off between efficacy and toxicity. The continual reassessment method (CRM) is an improvement over traditional up-and-down schemes for estimating the MTD. It is based on a Bayesian approach and on the assumption that the dose-toxicity relationship follows a specific response curve, e.g., the logistic or power curve. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how the assumption of a specific curve used in the CRM is not necessary and can actually hinder the efficient use of prior inputs. An alternative curve-free method in which the probabilities of toxicity are modeled directly as an unknown multidimensional parameter is presented. To that purpose, a product-of-beta prior (PBP) is introduced and shown to bring about logical improvements. Practical improvements are illustrated by simulation results.},

However, in situations where a low percentile is targeted, priors thus obtained can lead to undesirable rigidity given certain trial outcomes that can occur with a nonnegligible probability.

METHODS: We assessed sample size and analytic methods in IRGT trials published in 6 public health and behavioral health journals between 2002 and 2006.
RESULTS: Our review included 34 articles; in 32 (94.1\%) of these articles, inappropriate analytic methods were used. In only 1 article did the researchers claim that expected intraclass correlations (ICCs) were taken into account in sample size estimation; in most articles, sample size was not mentioned or ICCs were ignored in the reported calculations.
CONCLUSIONS: Trials in which individuals are randomly assigned to study conditions and treatments administered in groups may induce within-group correlation, violating the assumption of independence underlying commonly used statistical methods. Methods that take expected ICCs into account should be used in reexamining past studies and planning future studies to ensure that interventions are not judged effective solely on the basis of statistical artifacts. We strongly encourage investigators to report ICCs from IRGT trials and describe study characteristics clearly to aid these efforts.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dulaglutide (dula, LY2189265), a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, is being developed to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: To foster the development of dula, we designed a two-stage adaptive, dose-finding, inferentially seamless phase 2/3 study. The Bayesian theoretical framework is used to adaptively randomize patients in stage 1 to 7 dula doses and, at the decision point, to either stop for futility or to select up to 2 dula doses for stage 2. After dose selection, patients continue to be randomized to the selected dula doses or comparator arms. Data from patients assigned the selected doses will be pooled across both stages and analyzed with an analysis of covariance model, using baseline hemoglobin A1c and country as covariates. The operating characteristics of the trial were assessed by extensive simulation studies.
RESULTS: Simulations demonstrated that the adaptive design would identify the correct doses 88\% of the time, compared to as low as 6\% for a fixed-dose design (the latter value based on frequentist decision rules analogous to the Bayesian decision rules for adaptive design).
CONCLUSIONS: This article discusses the decision rules used to select the dula dose(s); the mathematical details of the adaptive algorithm-including a description of the clinical utility index used to mathematically quantify the desirability of a dose based on safety and efficacy measurements; and a description of the simulation process and results that quantify the operating characteristics of the design.},

METHODS: We used simulation to examine the impact of covariate adjustment on 12 outcomes from 8 studies across a range of therapeutic areas. We assessed (1) how large an increase in power can be expected in practice; and (2) the impact of adjustment for covariates that are not prognostic.
RESULTS: Adjustment for known prognostic covariates led to large increases in power for most outcomes. When power was set to 80\% based on an unadjusted analysis, covariate adjustment led to a median increase in power to 92.6\% across the 12 outcomes (range 80.6 to 99.4\%). Power was increased to over 85\% for 8 of 12 outcomes, and to over 95\% for 5 of 12 outcomes. Conversely, the largest decrease in power from adjustment for covariates that were not prognostic was from 80\% to 78.5\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjustment for known prognostic covariates can lead to substantial increases in power, and should be routinely incorporated into the analysis of randomized trials. The potential benefits of adjusting for a small number of possibly prognostic covariates in trials with moderate or large sample sizes far outweigh the risks of doing so, and so should also be considered.},

	abstract = {There has been constant development of novel statistical methods in the design of early-phase clinical trials since the introduction of model-based designs, yet the traditional or modified 3+3 algorithmic design remains the most widely used approach in dose-finding studies. Research has shown the limitations of this traditional design compared with more innovative approaches yet the use of these model-based designs remains infrequent. This can be attributed to several causes including a poor understanding from clinicians and reviewers into how the designs work, and how best to evaluate the appropriateness of a proposed design. These barriers are likely to be enhanced in the coming years as the recent paradigm of drug development involves a shift to more complex dose-finding problems. This article reviews relevant information that should be included in clinical trial protocols to aid in the acceptance and approval of novel methods. We provide practical guidance for implementing these efficient designs with the aim of augmenting a broader transition from algorithmic to adaptive model-guided designs. In addition we highlight issues to consider in the actual implementation of a trial once approval is obtained. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	doi = {10.1002/sim.4255},
	abstract = {The goal of phase I cancer trials is to determine the highest dose of a treatment regimen with an acceptable toxicity rate. Traditional designs for phase I trials, such as the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) and the 3 + 3 design, require each patient or a cohort of patients to be fully evaluated for the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) before new patients can be enrolled. As such, the trial duration may be prohibitively long. The Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method (TITE-CRM, Cheung and Chappell, 2000) circumvents this limitation by allowing staggered patient accrual without the need for complete DLT follow-up of previously treated patients. However, in the setting of fast patient accrual and late-onset toxicities, the TITE-CRM results in overly aggressive dose escalation and exposes a considerable number of patients to toxic doses. We examine a modification to the TITE-CRM proposed by the original TITE-CRM creator and propose an alternative approach useful in this setting by incorporating an accrual suspension rule. A simulation study designed based on a neuro-oncology trial indicates that the modified methods provide a much improved degree of safety than the TITE-CRM while maintaining desirable design accuracy. The practical aspects of the proposed designs are discussed. The modifications presented are useful when planning phase I trials involving chemoradiation therapy.},

	doi = {10.1093/biostatistics/kxm044},
	abstract = {Late-onset (LO) toxicities are a serious concern in many phase I trials. Since most dose-limiting toxicities occur soon after therapy begins, most dose-finding methods use a binary indicator of toxicity occurring within a short initial time period. If an agent causes LO toxicities, however, an undesirably large number of patients may be treated at toxic doses before any toxicities are observed. A method addressing this problem is the time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM, Cheung and Chappell, 2000). We propose a Bayesian dose-finding method similar to the TITE-CRM in which doses are chosen using time-to-toxicity data. The new aspect of our method is a set of rules, based on predictive probabilities, that temporarily suspend accrual if the risk of toxicity at prospective doses for future patients is unacceptably high. If additional follow-up data reduce the predicted risk of toxicity to an acceptable level, then accrual is restarted, and this process may be repeated several times during the trial. A simulation study shows that the proposed method provides a greater degree of safety than the TITE-CRM, while still reliably choosing the preferred dose. This advantage increases with accrual rate, but the price of this additional safety is that the trial takes longer to complete on average.},

MTAs differ from traditional cytotoxic agents in various aspects, including their toxicity profiles and the potential availability of predictive biomarkers of response. The landscape of phase I oncology trials is evolving to adapt to these novel therapies and to improve the efficiency of drug development. In this Review, we discuss new strategies used in phase I trial design, such as novel dose-escalation schemes to circumvent limitations of the classic 3 + 3 design and enable faster dose escalation and/or more-precise dose determinations using statistical modelling; improved selection of patients based on genetic or molecular biomarkers; pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses; and the early evaluation of efficacy - in addition to safety. Indeed, new expedited approval pathways that can accelerate drug development require demonstration of efficacy in early phase trials. The application of molecular tumour profiling for matched therapy and the testing of drug combinations based on a strong biological rationale are also increasingly seen in phase I studies. Finally, the shift towards multi-institutional trials and centralized study management results in consequent implications for institutions and investigators.

Many methods exist for conducting phase II trials under the assumption that patients are homogeneous. In the presence of patient heterogeneity, however, these designs are likely to draw incorrect conclusions. We propose a class of model-based Bayesian designs for single-arm phase II trials with a binary or time-to-event outcome and two or more prognostic subgroups. The designs' early stopping rules are subgroup specific and allow the possibility of terminating some subgroups while continuing others, thus providing superior results when compared with designs that ignore treatment-subgroup interactions. Because our formulation requires informative priors on standard treatment parameters and subgroup main effects, and non-informative priors on experimental treatment parameters and treatment-subgroup interactions, we provide an algorithm for computing prior hyperparameter values.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Phase I trials traditionally aim at determining the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) using grade ≥ 3 toxicity data from cycle 1 (C1) only. This design dates from the era of conventional chemotherapy and may not be relevant for new molecularly targeted agents (MTAs) usually administered in a chronic fashion and for which late or moderate toxicities may deserve particular attention.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All consecutive patients treated in phase I trials of MTAs at the Royal Marsden Hospital and Institut Gustave Roussy between January 2005 and July 2008 were included. Gastrointestinal, skin, and clinical renal toxicities of any grade and grades 3 to 4 toxic events of any type occurring at any cycle on treatment were recorded. Doses administered, treatment interruptions, dose modifications, and prescription of comedications were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 445 patients (1,566 cycles; median treatment duration, 55 days) were included in 36 eligible trials; 790 toxicities (590, grade 1; 176, grade, 2; 24 grades, 3 to 4) and 1,819 toxicities (1,521, grade 1; 265, grade 2; 33, grades 3 to 4) were recorded during and after C1, respectively; 57\% of the grades 3 to 4 toxicities occurred after C1; 50\% of patients presented their worst-grade toxicity after C1. The risk of grades 3 to 4 toxicity was 3\% in cycles 1 to 6 and was almost null afterwards. No cumulative toxicities were observed. Median toxicity duration was 15 days, with comedication administered in 68\% of events.
CONCLUSION: Moderate and severe toxicities occur regularly after the first cycle in phase I trials of MTAs and may deserve increased attention in the RP2D process for these agents.},

The chi-square test shows a good fit of the model to the data (P = 0.365). In addition to the parameters and their standard errors, estimates are computed for the expectation, variance, and percentiles of time to tumor, and for the age-specific cancer incidence rates.

In the model, three mathematic models are adopted to mimic physiological response of body under chemotherapy: (i) Pharmacokinetic model of anticancer drug; (ii) A two-compartment tumor growth dynamic model under the influence of cell-cycle-specific anticancer drugs; and (iii) A semi-mechanistic model for myelosuppression. In this new integrated model clinically relevant objectives are proposed to gain a trade-off between efficacy and toxicity. Simulation results of clinical protocols are consistent with real-life clinical data.

Optimal control problem formulations based on these models are proposed, discussed and compared. For different parameter sets, scenarios, and objective functions optimal control problems are solved numerically with Bock's direct multiple shooting method. In particular, we show that an optimally controlled therapy can be the reason for the difference between a growing and a totally vanishing tumor in comparison to standard treatment schemes and untreated or wrongly treated tumors. Furthermore, we compare different objective functions. Eventually, we propose an optimization-driven indicator for the potential gain of optimal controls. Based on this indicator, we show that there is a high potential for optimization of chemotherapy schedules, although the currently available models are not yet appropriate for transferring the optimal therapies into medical practice due to patient-, cancer-, and therapy-specific components.},

A constraint is imposed so that the tumour size must decrease at or faster than a specified rate. The system is solved using an established numerical solution technique known as control parametrization, and analytical gradients are constructed of all the constraints so that the resulting non-linear programming problem is solvable using currently available software. An interesting feature of the constraints on the rate of decrease of the tumour size is that the corresponding co-state functions are discontinuous in time. Numerical solutions suggest that the best way of reducing the tumour burden after a fixed period of treatment is to keep the rate of decrease of the tumour size to a minimum initially, and then give high-intensity treatment towards the end of the treatment period.},

Because of the large inter-individual variability (IIV) in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of docetaxel, it is challenging to determine the optimal dose in individual patients in order to achieve optimal efficacy and acceptable toxicity. Despite the established correlation between systemic docetaxel exposure and efficacy, the precise factors influencing docetaxel PK are not yet completely understood. This review article highlights currently known factors that influence docetaxel PK, and focusses on those that are clinically relevant. For example, liver impairment should be taken into account when calculating docetaxel dosages as this may decrease docetaxel clearance. In addition, drug-drug interactions may be of distinct clinical importance when using docetaxel. Particularly, drugs strongly inhibiting CYP3A4 such as ketoconazole should not be concurrently administered without dose modification, as they may decrease the clearance of docetaxel. Gender, castration status, and menopausal status might be of importance as potential factors influencing docetaxel PK. The role of pharmacogenetics in predicting docetaxel PK is still limited, since no polymorphisms of clinical importance have yet been established.},

	abstract = {Importance 
Advances in genomics have led to the recognition that tumors are populated by distinct genotypic subgroups that drive tumor development and progression. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of solid tumors has been a critical barrier to the development of precision medicine approaches because the standard approach to tumor sampling, often invasive needle biopsy, is unable to fully capture the spatial state of the tumor. Image-based phenotyping, which represents quantification of the tumor phenotype through medical imaging, is a promising development for precision medicine.Observations
Medical imaging can provide a comprehensive macroscopic picture of the tumor phenotype and its environment that is ideally suited to quantifying the development of the tumor phenotype before, during, and after treatment. As a noninvasive technique, medical imaging can be performed at low risk and inconvenience to the patient. The semantic features approach to tumor phenotyping, accomplished by visual assessment of radiologists, is compared with a computational radiomic approach that relies on automated processing of imaging assays. Together, these approaches capture important information for diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive purposes.Conclusions and Relevance
Although imaging technology is already embedded in clinical practice for diagnosis, staging, treatment planning, and response assessment, the transition of these computational methods to the clinic has been surprisingly slow. This review outlines the promise of these novel technologies for precision medicine and the obstacles to clinical application.},

	doi = {10.1111/j.1365-2125.2010.03621.x},
	abstract = {AIM: Docetaxel has a low oral bioavailability due to affinity for P-glycoprotein and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzymes. Inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzymes by ritonavir resulted in increased oral bioavailability. The aim of this study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model and to evaluate and quantify the influence of ritonavir on the PK of docetaxel.
METHODS: Data from two clinical trials were included in the data analysis, in which docetaxel (75 mg m(-2) or 100 mg) had been administered intravenously or orally (10 mg or 100 mg) with or without co-administration of oral ritonavir (100 mg). Population modelling was performed using non-linear mixed effects modelling. A three-compartment model was used to describe the i.v. data. PK data after oral administration, with or without co-administration of ritonavir, were incorporated into the model.
RESULTS: Gut bioavailability of docetaxel increased approximately two-fold from 19 to 39\% (CV 13\%) with ritonavir co-administration. The hepatic extraction ratio and the elimination rate of docetaxel were best described by estimating the intrinsic clearance. Ritonavir was found to inhibit in a concentration dependent manner the intrinsic clearance of docetaxel, which was described by an inhibition constant of 0.028 microg ml(-1) (CV 36\%). A maximum inhibition of docetaxel clearance of more then 90\% was reached.
CONCLUSIONS: A PK model describing both the PK of orally and intravenously administered docetaxel in combination with ritonavir, was successfully developed. Co-administration of ritonavir lead to increased oral absorption and reduced elimination rate of docetaxel.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to assess the feasibility, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of an escalating dose of docetaxel when administered with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support every 3 weeks.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with advanced solid malignancies were treated with escalating doses of docetaxel as a 1-h infusion every 3 weeks, supported by s.c. administration of human recombinant glycosilated G-CSF Granocyte (lenograstim), 5 microg/kg/day (from day 4 until neutrophil count {\textgreater}0.5-10(g)/liter for two consecutive days). Plasma sampling was performed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel at the new recommended high-dose level.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were treated with 116 courses of docetaxel at eight dose levels ranging from 100-185 mg/m(2). Dose-limiting toxicities were nonhematologic and included mucositis and dermatitis. Severe skin toxicity observed at 185 mg/m(2) led to discontinuing the study, and 175 mg/m(2) was selected as the recommended dose of docetaxel + G-CSF for future Phase II studies. Analysis of multiple courses revealed dermatitis, mucositis, arthralgia/myalgia, and neuropathy as the main dose-related toxic events. At 175 mg/m(2) mean +/- SD values for docetaxel plasmatic peak, area under the curve, clearance, volume of distribution, and terminal half-life were 6.7 +/- 1.7 microg/ml, 9.7 +/- 4 microg.h/ml, 34.2 +/- 12 liters/h, and 122.7 +/- 124 liters, respectively. Of the 16 patients treated at 175 mg/m(2), 8 patients responded (7 breast cancer and 1 lung cancer patients) including one complete response (1 breast cancer patient).

However, the simultaneous presence of the CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A5*1A alleles was associated with a 64\% increase in docetaxel clearance (P = 0.0015), independent of both sex and CYP3A activity (as determined using the erythromycin breath test). This haplotype was also associated with increased midazolam clearance in another population (P = 0.0198). An analysis of the CYP3A locus among CEPH-HapMap samples revealed that CYP3A4*1B is present exclusively among a subset of CYP3A5 expressors. Therefore, future studies should first stratify the population on the basis of CYP3A5 genotype and then compare CYP3A activity between individuals with and without the CYP3A4*1B allele.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Docetaxel is frequently used in the treatment of a wide variety of solid tumors, including breast cancer. The aim of this study is to obtain the population pharmacokinetic parameters of docetaxel in Japanese female patients with breast cancer.
METHODS: Blood samples from 24 patients were collected sequentially before and after docetaxel infusion. Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood and genotyped for the selected polymorphisms in the candidate genes of drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes. The influence of patient characteristics on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was evaluated using the nonlinear-mixed-effect modeling program, NONMEM. As a basis for comparison, the pharmacokinetics of another taxane paclitaxel in 41 separate female patients with breast cancer was calculated.
RESULTS: A two-compartment model adequately described the pharmacokinetic profiles of docetaxel. The population mean estimates of the total body clearance for patients aged 58 years or less and the central volume of distribution for docetaxel were 32.6 L/h and 5.77 L, respectively. In patients over 58 years, the clearance was 24 \% higher than that in the younger patients. No influences of the genotypes examined were noted on the clearance of docetaxel. The clearance of paclitaxel was not affected by patient age.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients over the age of 58 years showed significantly higher clearance of docetaxel than that in patients aged 58 years or less. Since the clearance of paclitaxel was not affected by the age, it is possible that the pharmacokinetic mechanisms of docetaxel might be specifically affected by age in females.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The herbal medicine Echinacea purpurea (E. purpurea) has been shown to induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) both in vitro and in humans. This study explored whether E. purpurea affects the pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A4 substrate docetaxel in cancer patients.
METHODS: Ten evaluable cancer patients received docetaxel (135 mg, 60 min IV infusion) before intake of a commercially available E. purpurea extract (20 oral drops three times daily) and 3 weeks later after a 14 day supplementation period with E. purpurea. In both cycles, pharmacokinetic parameters of docetaxel were determined.
RESULTS: Before and after supplementation with E. purpurea, the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve of docetaxel was 3278 ± 1086 and 3480 ± 1285 ng ml(-1) h, respectively. This result was statistically not significant. Nonsignificant alterations were also observed for the elimination half-life (from 30.8 ± 19.7 to 25.6 ± 5.9 h, P = 0.56) and maximum plasma concentration of docetaxel (from 2224 ± 609 to 2097 ± 925 ng ml(-1) , P = 0.30).
CONCLUSIONS: The multiple treatment of E. purpurea did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel in this study. The applied E. purpurea product at the recommended dose may be combined safely with docetaxel in cancer patients.},

	abstract = {A sparse sampling strategy (3 samples per patient, 521 patients) was implemented in 22 Phase 2 studies of docetaxel (Taxotere) at the first treatment cycle for a prospective population pharmacokinetic evaluation. In addition to the 521 Phase 2 patients, 26 (data rich) patients from Phase I studies were included in the analysis. NONMEM analysis of an index set of 280 patients demonstrated that docetaxel clearance (CL) is related to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) level, hepatic function (HEP), age (AGE), and body surface area (BSA). The index set population model prediction of CL was compared to that of a naive predictor (NP) using a validation set of 267 patients. Qualitatively, the dependence of CL on AAG, AGE, BSA, and HEP seen in the index set population model was supported in the validation set. Quantitatively, for the validation set patients overall, the performance (bias, precision) of the model was good (7 and 21\%, respectively), although not better than that of the NP. However, in all the subpopulations with decreased CL, the model performed better than the NP; the more the CL differed from the population average, the better the performance. For example, in the subpopulation of patients with AAG levels {\textgreater} 2.27 g/L (n = 26), bias and precision of model predictions were 24 and 32\% vs. 53 and 53\%, respectively, for the NP. The prediction of CL using the model was better (than that of the NP) in 73\% of the patients. The population model was redetermined using the whole population of 547 patients and a new covariate, albumin plasma level, was found to be a significant predictor in addition to those found previously. In the final model, HEP, AAG, and BSA are the main predictors of docetaxel CL.},

	volume = {16},
	issn = {0732-183X},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: The population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) approach was prospectively integrated in the clinical development of docetaxel to assess the PK profile in a large population of patients and investigate systemic exposure as a prognostic factor for clinical outcome.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: PK analysis was performed at first course in 24 phase II studies of docetaxel monotherapy using four randomized limited-sampling schedules. Bayesian estimates of clearance (CL), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and peak and duration of plasma levels greater than threshold levels were used as measures of exposure. PD data included for efficacy, response rate, time to first response, and time to progression (TTP) in breast cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and for toxicity, grade 4 neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia at first course and time to onset of fluid retention. PK/PD analysis was conducted using logistic and Cox multivariate regression models.
RESULTS: PK protocol implementation was successful. Most of the patients registered (721 of 936, 77\%) were sampled and 68\% were assessable for PK (640 patients). First-course docetaxel AUC was a significant predictor (P = .0232) of TTP in NSCLC (n = 151). Docetaxel CL was a strong independent predictor (P {\textless} .0001) of both grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia (n = 582). Cumulative dose was the strongest predictor (P {\textless} .0001) of the time to onset of fluid retention (n = 631). However, the duration of exposure over 0.20 micromol/L (0.16 microg/mL) at first course was an independent predictor (P = .0029). Few patients (n = 25, 4\%) received the recommended dexamethasone premedication.
CONCLUSION: First-course docetaxel PK is a predictor of first-course hematologic toxicity, but also of fluid retention, which is cumulative in nature. Patients with elevated hepatic enzymes have a 27\% reduction in docetaxel CL and are at a higher risk of toxicity. A starting dose of 75 mg/m2 is currently being evaluated in this population. Prospective implementation of large-scale population PK/PD evaluation is feasible in early drug development and this approach generates clinically relevant findings.},

Although pharmacokinetic variability is an established factor involved in the variation of therapeutic outcome of many chemotherapeutic agents, the use of TDM in the field of oncology has been limited thus far. An important reason for this is that a therapeutic index for most anticancer agents has not been established; however, in the last 20 years, relationships between plasma drug concentrations and clinical outcome have been defined for various chemotherapeutic agents. Several attempts have been made to use these relationships for optimising the administration of chemotherapeutics by applying pharmacokinetically guided dosage. These prospective studies, individualising chemotherapy dose during therapy based on measured drug concentrations, are discussed in this review. We focus on the way a target value is defined, the methodologies used for dose adaptation and the way the performance of the dose-adaptation approach is evaluated. Furthermore, attention is paid to the results of the studies and the applicability of the strategies in clinical practice. It can be concluded that TDM may contribute to improving cancer chemotherapy in terms of patient outcome and survival and should therefore be further investigated.},

	abstract = {This article examines the use of population pharmacokinetic models to store experiences about drugs in patients and to apply that experience to the care of new patients. Population models are the Bayesian prior. For truly individualised therapy, it is necessary first to select a specific target goal, such as a desired serum or peripheral compartment concentration, and then to develop the dosage regimen individualised to best hit that target in that patient. One must monitor the behaviour of the drug by measuring serum concentrations or other responses, hopefully obtained at optimally chosen times, not only to see the raw results, but to also make an individualised (Bayesian posterior) model of how the drug is behaving in that patient. Only then can one see the relationship between the dose and the absorption, distribution, effect and elimination of the drug, and the patient's clinical sensitivity to it; one must always look at the patient. Only by looking at both the patient and the model can it be judged whether the target goal was correct or needs to be changed. The adjusted dosage regimen is again developed to hit that target most precisely starting with the very next dose, not just for some future steady state. Nonparametric population models have discrete, not continuous, parameter distributions. These lead naturally into the multiple model method of dosage design, specifically to hit a desired target with the greatest possible precision for whatever past experience and present data are available on that drug--a new feature for this goal-oriented, model-based, individualised drug therapy. As clinical versions of this new approach become available from several centers, it should lead to further improvements in patient care, especially for bacterial and viral infections, cardiovascular therapy, and cancer and transplant situations.},

Analysis of simulated data with NONMEM shows that ignoring such interoccasion variability (IOV) may result in biased population parameter estimates. Particular parameters affected and the extent to which they are biased depend on study design and the magnitude of IOV and interindividual variability. Neglecting IOV also results in a high incidence of statistically significant spurious period effects. Perhaps most important, ignoring IOV can lead to a falsely optimistic impression of the potential value of therapeutic drug monitoring. A model incorporating IOV was developed and its performance in the presence and absence of IOV was evaluated. The IOV model performs well with respect to both model selection and population parameter estimation in all circumstances studied. Analysis of two real data examples using this model reveals significant IOV in all parameters for both drugs and supports the simulation findings for the case that IOV is ignored: predictable biases occur in parameter estimates and previously nonexistent period effects are found.},

	abstract = {Present knowledge concerning the kinetics of granulopoiesis has been reviewed and quantitative data concerning granulokinetics in normal human subjects are presented.
A. When granulocytes are labeled in vitro and returned to the circulation of the donor, the distribution of the cells in the circulation and the rate of disappearance of the cells from the circulation can be measured.
1. The total blood granulocyte pool (TBGP) consists of two compartments which are in equilibrium with each other. These pools have been designated the circulating granulocyte pool (CGP) and the marginal granulocyte pool (MGP). The size of the pools has been measured in 109 normal male subjects. The mean values, expressed as numbers of cells x 107 per Kg. of body weight were as follows: TBGP, 70; CGP, 31; and MGP, 39. The mean ratio of the CGP to the TBGP was 0.44.
2. The labeled granulocytes leave the TBGP in an exponential fashion with a mean half-time disappearance (T½) of 6.7 hours as determined in 56 normal male subjects. No evidence has been obtained for a return of granulocytes to the blood.
3. The mean value for the granulocyte turnover rate (GTR) in 56 normal male subjects was 163 x 107 granulocytes per Kg. of body weight per day. Thus, the TBGP turns over 2.3 times per day and the turnover time for the TBGP is 10.4 hours.
B. When granulocytes are labeled in vivo by the intravenous administration of DFP32, the rate of disappearance of granulocytes from the circulation and the time required for myelocytes to divide, mature and appear in the blood can be measured. In addition, the generation time of myelocytes can be approximated. From the time parameters and the GTR, the bone marrow pool sizes and turnover times can be calculated. These determinations and calculations have been made for a group of 21 normal male subjects.
1. The mean half-time disappearance (T½) of in vivo labeled granulocytes from the circulation was 7.2 hours. This value agrees well with the value of 6.7 hours obtained after the in vitro labeling of granulocytes.
2. The mean time required for myelocytes to divide, mature and appear in the blood was 11.4 days.
3. The mean generation time of myelocytes was estimated to be not more than 2.9 days.
4. The total granulocyte pool in the bone marrow (neutrophilic myelocytes, neutrophilic metamyelocytes and PMN neutrophils) was calculated to be 186 x 108 cells per Kg. of body weight with a mean turnover time of 11.4 days. The myelocyte pool was estimated to be 41 x 108 cells per Kg. with a turnover time of 2.5 days; the metamyelocyte pool consisted of about 76 x 108 cells per Kg. with a turnover time of 4.7 days; the average size of the mature marrow PMN neutrophil pool was 69 x 108 cells per Kg. of body weight with a turnover time of 4.2 days.
C. A kinetic model for granulopoiesis, based on the studies with the DFP32 label, is presented. In this model, myelocytes are depicted as approaching a self-perpetuating population of cells. Some cells enter this population from populations which are less mature but this latter source of cells is small under conditions of normal steady state kinetics. One of the daughter cells of a myelocyte division remains in the myelocyte population to divide again. The other daughter cell enters the metamyelocyte population. The metamyelocyte and PMN neutrophil population is incapable of division and cells move through this population in sequential fashion in the process of maturation. The cells then enter the blood where they equilibrate rapidly between the two blood compartments. The cells are removed from the total granulocyte pool in a random fashion. There is no appreciable pool of granulocytes in the extramedullary tissues of normal subjects and granulocytes do not return from the tissues to the blood. The entire movement of granulocytes from marrow to tissues is uni-directional.},

	abstract = {Purpose This phase I expansion cohort study evaluated the safety and clinical activity of mirvetuximab soravtansine (IMGN853), an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of a humanized anti-folate receptor alpha (FRα) monoclonal antibody linked to the tubulin-disrupting maytansinoid DM4, in a population of patients with FRα-positive and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Patients and Methods Patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer received IMGN853 at 6.0 mg/kg (adjusted ideal body weight) once every 3 weeks. Eligibility included a minimum requirement of FRα positivity by immunohistochemistry (≥ 25\% of tumor cells with at least 2+ staining intensity). Adverse events, tumor response (via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1), and progression-free survival (PFS) were determined. Results Forty-six patients were enrolled. Adverse events were generally mild (≤ grade 2), with diarrhea (44\%), blurred vision (41\%), nausea (37\%), and fatigue (30\%) being the most commonly observed treatment-related toxicities. Grade 3 fatigue and hypotension were reported in two patients each (4\%). For all evaluable patients, the confirmed objective response rate was 26\%, including one complete and 11 partial responses, and the median PFS was 4.8 months. The median duration of response was 19.1 weeks. Notably, in the subset of patients who had received three or fewer prior lines of therapy (n = 23), an objective response rate of 39\%, PFS of 6.7 months, and duration of response of 19.6 weeks were observed. Conclusion IMGN853 exhibited a manageable safety profile and was active in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, with the strongest signals of efficacy observed in less heavily pretreated individuals. On the basis of these findings, the dose, schedule, and target population were identified for a phase III trial of IMGN853 monotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent phase 3 trials have shown an overall survival benefit in metastatic melanoma. We aimed to assess whether progression-free survival (PFS) could be regarded as a reliable surrogate for overall survival through a meta-analysis of randomised trials.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed randomised trials comparing treatment regimens in metastatic melanoma that included dacarbazine as the control arm, and which reported both PFS and overall survival with a standard hazard ratio (HR). We correlated HRs for overall survival and PFS, weighted by sample size or by precision of the HR estimate, assuming fixed and random effects. We did sensitivity analyses according to presence of crossover, trial size, and dacarbazine dose.
FINDINGS: After screening 1649 reports and meeting abstracts published before Sept 8, 2013, we identified 12 eligible randomised trials that enrolled 4416 patients with metastatic melanoma. Irrespective of weighting strategy, we noted a strong correlation between the treatment effects for PFS and overall survival, which seemed independent of treatment type. Pearson correlation coefficients were 0·71 (95\% CI 0·29-0·90) with a random-effects assumption, 0·85 (0·59-0·95) with a fixed-effects assumption, and 0·89 (0·68-0·97) with sample-size weighting. For nine trials without crossover, the correlation coefficient was 0·96 (0·81-0·99), which decreased to 0·93 (0·74-0·98) when two additional trials with less than 50\% crossover were included. Inclusion of mature follow-up data after at least 50\% crossover (in vemurafenib and dabrafenib phase 3 trials) weakened the PFS to overall survival correlation (0·55, 0·03-0·84). Inclusion of trials with no or little crossover with the random-effects assumption yielded a conservative statement of the PFS to overall survival correlation of 0·85 (0·51-0·96).
INTERPRETATION: PFS can be regarded as a robust surrogate for overall survival in dacarbazine-controlled randomised trials of metastatic melanoma; we postulate that this association will hold as treatment standards evolve and are adopted as the control arm in future trials.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ipilimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 and has shown promising activity in advanced melanoma. We aimed to ascertain the antitumour efficacy of ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma.
METHODS: We undertook a randomised, double-blind, phase 2 trial in 66 centres from 12 countries. 217 patients with previously treated stage III (unresectable) or stage IV melanoma were randomly assigned a fixed dose of ipilimumab of either 10 mg/kg (n=73), 3 mg/kg (n=72), or 0.3 mg/kg (n=72) every 3 weeks for four cycles (induction) followed by maintenance therapy every 3 months. Randomisation was done with a permuted block procedure, stratified on the basis of type of previous treatment. The primary endpoint was best overall response rate (the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response, according to modified WHO criteria). Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat, whereas safety analyses included patients who received at least one dose of ipilimumab. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00289640.
FINDINGS: The best overall response rate was 11.1\% (95\% CI 4.9-20.7) for 10 mg/kg, 4.2\% (0.9-11.7) for 3 mg/kg, and 0\% (0.0-4.9) for 0.3 mg/kg (p=0.0015; trend test). Immune-related adverse events of any grade arose in 50 of 71, 46 of 71, and 19 of 72 patients at doses of 10 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 0.3 mg/kg, respectively; the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were gastrointestinal immune-related events (11 in the 10 mg/kg group, two in the 3 mg/kg group, none in the 0.3 mg/kg group) and diarrhoea (ten in the 10 mg/kg group, one in the 3 mg/kg group, none in the 0.3 mg/kg group).
INTERPRETATION: Ipilimumab elicited a dose-dependent effect on efficacy and safety measures in pretreated patients with advanced melanoma, lending support to further studies at a dose of 10 mg/kg.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The anti-programmed-death-receptor-1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab has shown potent antitumour activity at different doses and schedules in patients with melanoma. We compared the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab at doses of 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks in patients with ipilimumab-refractory advanced melanoma.
METHODS: In an open-label, international, multicentre expansion cohort of a phase 1 trial, patients (aged ≥18 years) with advanced melanoma whose disease had progressed after at least two ipilimumab doses were randomly assigned with a computer-generated allocation schedule (1:1 final ratio) to intravenous pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. Primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) assessed with the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) by independent central review. Analysis was done on the full-analysis set (all treated patients with measurable disease at baseline). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01295827.
FINDINGS: 173 patients received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (n=89) or 10 mg/kg (n=84). Median follow-up duration was 8 months. ORR was 26\% at both doses--21 of 81 patients in the 2 mg/kg group and 20 of 76 in the 10 mg/kg group (difference 0\%, 95\% CI -14 to 13; p=0·96). Treatment was well tolerated, with similar safety profiles in the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups and no drug-related deaths. The most common drug-related adverse events of any grade in the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups were fatigue (29 [33\%] vs 31 [37\%]), pruritus (23 [26\%] vs 16 [19\%]), and rash (16 [18\%] vs 15 [18\%]). Grade 3 fatigue, reported in five (3\%) patients in the 2 mg/kg pembrolizumab group, was the only drug-related grade 3 to 4 adverse event reported in more than one patient.
INTERPRETATION: The results suggest that pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks might be an effective treatment in patients for whom there are few effective treatment options.

	issn = {1460-2105},
	doi = {10.1093/jnci/djs439},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To date, the primary objective of phase I trials has been to safely select the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a drug or drug combination for utilization in subsequent trials. Although conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally more effective at the MTD than molecularly targeted agents (MTAs), recent single-institution data suggest that molecularly targeted agent may not require an MTD for efficacy. We analyzed patient outcome results in MTA phase I trials at multiple institutions throughout North America sponsored by the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected and analyzed data on patients treated on monotherapy phase I trials investigating novel MTAs with a defined MTD from 2000 to 2009. Logistic regression analysis was used to test whether there was an increase in the probability of a response as dose increased. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine if overall survival increased with increasing dose. All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: We analyzed 1908 patients treated on 55 eligible clinical trials. The probability of both overall response (complete response plus partial response) and overall survival increased with increasing dose (odds ratio for increased response = 1.56, P = .10; hazard ratio for death = 0.37, P = .008) when controlling for study as a covariate.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated in the context of phase I trials with MTAs continue to derive reasonable clinical benefit. Contrary to other single institution data, our data suggest clinical benefit in terms of increasing response and overall survival with increasing dose.},

As a result of this amendment, FDA formalized in regulation the definitions of various phases of clinical investigations (i.e., phase I, phase II, and phase III). The clinical drug development paradigm for anticancer drugs intended to support marketing approval has historically followed this "phased" approach with sequential, stand-alone trials, with an increasing number of patients exposed to an investigational drug with each trial in order to fulfill the objectives of that particular stage in development. Increasingly, it is the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products' experience that commercial sponsors of solid tumor oncology drug development programs are amending ongoing phase I trials to add expansion cohorts designed to evaluate study objectives typical of later-phase trials. For investigational anticancer drugs that demonstrate preliminary clinical evidence of substantial antitumor activity early in clinical testing, use of expansion cohorts as a component of the solid tumor oncology drug development pathway, with appropriate measures to mitigate the risks of this approach, may fit in well with the goals and concepts described by FDA's expedited programs for serious conditions.},

	abstract = {While there is an extensive amount of literature covering prospective designs for phase I trials, the methodology for analyzing these data is limited. Prospective designs select the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) through a dose escalation scheme based on a model or on empirical rules. For example, the '3 + 3' method (standard method: SM) assigns patients in cohorts of three and expands to six if one toxicity is observed. It has been shown previously that the MTD chosen by the SM may be low, possibly leading to a non-efficacious dose. Additionally, when deviation from the original trial design occurs, the rules for determining MTD might not be applicable. We hypothesize that a retrospective analysis would suggest an MTD that is more accurate than the one obtained by the SM. A weighted Continual Reassessment Method (CRM-w) has been suggested (Biometrics 2005; 61:749-756) for analyzing data obtained from designs other than the prospective Continual Reassessment Method (CRM). However, CRM-w has not been evaluated in trials that follow the SM design. In this study, we propose a method to analyze completed phase I trials and possibly confirm or amend the recommended phase II dose, based on a constrained maximum likelihood estimation (CMLE). A comparison of CRM-w, isotonic regression, and CMLE in analyzing simulated SM trials shows that CMLE more accurately selects the true MTD than SM, and is better or comparable to isotonic regression and CRM-w.

This article provides guidelines on how to monitor safety and re-evaluate the MTD using data obtained from expansion cohorts of phase I protocols. We illustrate how to implement a sequential monitoring rule for safety using a completed phase I trial that included an expansion cohort. We compare the accuracy of the revised MTD with the MTD obtained before expansion and with the true MTD based on simulated trials. The percent of trials that led to a change in the MTD, how far the revised MTD was from the true MTD, and the toxicity rates associated with each level are reported. When toxicity outcomes from the expansion cohort are taken into account, there is a 50\% chance that a new, higher MTD will be recommended. Significant improvement in the accuracy of the MTD is obtained 30\% of the time (ie, revised MTD is exactly the true MTD), and moderate improvement is obtained 80\% of the time when the revised MTD is within a level from true MTD. Failure to include toxicity outcomes from additional patients treated during the expansion phase may result in a less accurate estimate of the MTD. This article provides investigators of phase I protocols with methodological tools to monitor safety and/or efficacy for patients accrued during the expansion phase and to update or confirm the established MTD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND{\textless}br{\textgreater}Even after a decade of great advances for Bayesian adaptive design and model-based dose-finding, oncology dose-finding studies continue to pursue the mirage of ‘the’ maximum tolerated dose (MTD). This fallacious, anti-precision concept maintains a pretext for one-size-fits-all dosing that ignores the long-recognized heterogeneity of cancer patients’ pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), as well as the equally important diversity of their individual \textit{values} and \textit{goals of care}. Under this conceptual yoke, these dose-finding studies constitute a significant choke-point in drug development, where a severe discount may be applied to the potential value in new molecules through the hobbling of subsequent efficacy trials by inadequate individual-level dosing.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}DOSE TITRATION ALGORITHM TUNING{\textless}br{\textgreater}Dose Titration Algorithm Tuning (DTAT), a new methodologic advance [1], shows we can reconceive the aim of early-phase drug studies, not as ‘dose-finding’, but now as \textit{dose titration algorithm (DTA)}-finding. This new conception lets us see through the mirage of \textit{‘the’ MTD}, to a properly individualized notion of \textit{MTD$_{\textrm{i}}$}.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}IMPACT ON PATIENTS \&amp; INNOVATION{\textless}br{\textgreater}A large body of literature stretching back 2 decades ([2-4], \textit{inter alia}) shows that patients who have adverse effects (such as neutropenia) from their chemotherapy also have better outcomes from treatment. DTAT allows safe titration to \textit{each individual patient’s} maximum tolerated dose, so that each patient gets his or her best chance of achieving a remission. This, in turn, gives each investigational new drug (IND) the best chance to succeed in Phase 2 and 3 efficacy trials.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}BEYOND THE CYTOTOXICS{\textless}br{\textgreater}In the important area of immuno-oncology, common dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) admit monitoring on time-scales comparable to the chemotherapy induced neutropenia (CIN) simulated in [1]. The \textit{cytokine release syndrome} (CRS) that accompanies CAR-T therapies, for example, typically arises within 1 week of administration (even earlier with concomitant high-dose IL-2) and constitutes a clinical \textit{syndrome} that admits multivariate monitoring on numerous quantitative clinical and laboratory measures. Even molecularly targeted agents (MTAs), for which \textit{late} toxicities have attracted the lion’s share of attention, remain accessible to the DTAT principle—with DTA learning simply occurring on a longer time scale.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}WHAT DTAT MEANS TO YOU{\textless}br{\textgreater}DTAT presents a \textit{prima facie} case for discarding the outmoded concept of ‘the’ maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cancer therapeutics. The DTAT principle should be of interest to a wide range of stakeholders, from cancer patients with a stake in receiving optimal individualized ‘MTD$_{\textrm{i}}$’ dosing, to shareholders in pharmaceutical innovation with a stake in efficient dosefinding before Phase III trials.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}REFERENCES

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer and its treatment lead to increased financial distress for patients. To the authors' knowledge, to date, no standardized patient-reported outcome measure has been validated to assess this distress.
METHODS: Patients with AJCC Stage IV solid tumors receiving chemotherapy for at least 2 months were recruited. Financial toxicity was measured by the COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity (COST) measure. The authors collected data regarding patient characteristics, clinical trial participation, health care use, willingness to discuss costs, psychological distress (Brief Profile of Mood States [POMS]), and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: General (FACT-G) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QOL questionnaires. Test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and validity of the COST measure were assessed using standard-scale construction techniques. Associations between the resulting factors and other variables were assessed using multivariable analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 375 patients with advanced cancer were approached, 233 of whom (62.1\%) agreed to participate. The COST measure demonstrated high internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Factor analyses revealed a coherent, single, latent variable (financial toxicity). COST values were found to be correlated with income (correlation coefficient [r] = 0.28; P{\textless}.001), psychosocial distress (r = -0.26; P{\textless}.001), and HRQOL, as measured by the FACT-G (r = 0.42; P{\textless}.001) and by the EORTC QOL instruments (r = 0.33; P{\textless}.001). Independent factors found to be associated with financial toxicity were race (P = .04), employment status (P{\textless}.001), income (P = .003), number of inpatient admissions (P = .01), and psychological distress (P = .003). Willingness to discuss costs was not found to be associated with the degree of financial distress (P = .49).
CONCLUSIONS: The COST measure demonstrated reliability and validity in measuring financial toxicity. Its correlation with HRQOL indicates that financial toxicity is a clinically relevant patient-centered outcome. Cancer 2017;123:476-484. © 2016 American Cancer Society.},

	doi = {10.1186/s40064-016-2457-1},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) overexpression is associated with poor prognosis ER-negative breast cancer. GR antagonism with mifepristone increases chemotherapy-induced breast cancer cell death, therefore we conducted a phase I clinical trial of mifepristone and nab-paclitaxel in advanced breast cancer.
METHODS: A novel randomized phase I design was used to assess the effect of mifepristone on nab-paclitaxel pharmacokinetics and toxicity. Patients were randomized to placebo or mifepristone for the first cycle; mifepristone was given to all for subsequent cycles.
RESULTS: Nine patients were enrolled. All were found to have a twofold or greater increase in serum cortisol after mifepristone administration, reflecting effective GR inhibition. Neutropenia occurred at both nab-paclitaxel dose levels studied (100 and 80 mg/m(2)), and was easily managed with dose reduction and/or growth factor administration. Pharmacokinetic data suggest an interaction between nab-paclitaxel and mifepristone in some patients. Two patients had complete responses (CR), three partial responses (PR), one stable disease (SD), and three progressive disease (PD). Immunohistochemical staining for GR found six of nine tumors were GR-positive. All six GR-positive tumors were triple-negative at the time of recurrence. Of these six patients, two had CRs, two PRs, one SD, and one PD.
CONCLUSIONS: GR appears to be a promising target in TNBC, and GR inhibition plus chemotherapy produces manageable toxicity. While neutropenia was observed in some, a nab-paclitaxel dose of 100 mg/m(2) plus mifepristone 300 mg was found to be tolerable, and a randomized phase II trial of nab-paclitaxel with/without mifepristone is planned in GR-positive advanced TNBC.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The use of biopsy-derived pharmacodynamic biomarkers is increasing in early-phase clinical trials. It remains unknown whether drug development is accelerated or enhanced by their use. We examined the impact of biopsy-derived pharmacodynamic biomarkers on subsequent drug development through a comprehensive analysis of phase I oncology studies from 2003 to 2010 and subsequent publications citing the original trials.
METHODS: We conducted a search to identify and examine publications of phase I oncology studies including the use of biopsy-derived pharmacodynamic biomarkers between 2003 and 2010. Characteristics of those studies were extracted and analyzed, along with outcomes from the biomarker data. We then compiled and reviewed publications of subsequent phase II and III trials citing the original phase I biomarker studies to determine the impact on drug development.
RESULTS: We identified 4,840 phase I oncology publications between 2003 and 2010. Seventy-two studies included a biopsy-derived pharmacodynamic biomarker. The proportion of biomarker studies including nondiagnostic biopsies increased over time (P = .002). A minimum of 1,873 tumor biopsies were documented in the 72 studies, 12 of which reported a statistically significant biomarker result. Thirty-three percent of studies (n = 24) were referenced by subsequent publications specifically with regard to the biomarkers. Only five positive biomarker studies were cited subsequently, and maximum tolerated dose was used for subsequent drug development in all cases.
CONCLUSION: Despite their increased use, the impact of biopsy-derived pharmacodynamic biomarkers in phase I oncology studies on subsequent drug development remains uncertain. No impact on subsequent dose or schedule was demonstrated. This issue requires further evaluation, given the risk and cost of such studies.},

A minority of patients, however, fail to respond to treatment or relapse due to drug resistance. One primary driving factor of drug resistance are point mutations within the driving oncogene. Laboratory studies have shown that different leukemic mutants respond differently to different drugs, so a promising way to improve treatment efficacy is to combine multiple targeted therapies. We build a mathematical model to predict the dynamics of different leukemic mutants with imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib, and employ optimization techniques to find the best treatment schedule of combining the three drugs sequentially. Our study shows that the optimally designed combination therapy is more effective at controlling the leukemic cell burden than any monotherapy under a wide range of scenarios. The structure of the optimal schedule depends heavily on the mutant types present, growth kinetics of leukemic cells and drug toxicity parameters. Our methodology is an important step towards the design of personalized optimal therapeutic schedules for chronicle myeloid leukemia.},

	doi = {10.1177/1740774507076934},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditionally, phase I clinical trial designs are based upon one predefined course of treatment while varying among patients the dose given at each administration. In actual medical practice, patients receive a schedule comprised of several courses of treatment, and some patients may receive one or more dose reductions or delays during treatment. Consequently, the overall risk of toxicity for each patient is a function of both actual schedule of treatment and the differing doses used at each adminstration.
PURPOSE: Our goal is to provide a practical phase I clinical trial design that more accurately reflects actual medical practice by accounting for both dose per administration and schedule.
METHODS: We propose an outcome-adaptive Bayesian design that simultaneously optimizes both dose and schedule in terms of the overall risk of toxicity, based on time-to-toxicity outcomes. We use computer simulation as a tool to calibrate design parameters.
RESULTS: We describe a phase I trial in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation that was designed and is currently being conducted using our new method. Our computer simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms any method that searches for an optimal dose but does not allow schedule to vary, both in terms of the probability of identifying optimal (dose, schedule) combinations, and the numbers of patients assigned to those combinations in the trial.
LIMITATIONS: Our design requires greater sample sizes than those seen in traditional phase I studies due to the larger number of treatment combinations examined. Our design also assumes that the effects of multiple administrations are independent of each other and that the hazard of toxicity is the same for all administrations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our design is the first for phase I clinical trials that is sufficiently flexible and practical to truly reflect clinical practice by varying both dose and the timing and number of administrations given to each patient.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recurrence is a major cause of treatment failure after allogeneic transplantation for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and treatment options are very limited. Azacitidine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor with activity in myeloid disease. The authors hypothesized that low-dose azacitidine administered after transplant would reduce recurrence rates, and conducted a study to determine a safe dose/schedule combination.
METHODS: Forty-five high-risk patients were treated. Median age was 60 years; median number of comorbidities was 3; 67\% were not in remission. By using a Bayesian adaptive method to determine the best dose/schedule combination based on time to toxicity, the authors investigated combinations of 5 daily azacitidine doses, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 mg/m2, and 4 schedules: 1, 2, 3, or 4 cycles, each with 5 days of drug and 25 days of rest. Cycle 1 started on Day +40.
RESULTS: Reversible thrombocytopenia was the dose-limiting toxicity. The optimal combination was 32 mg/m2 given for 4 cycles. Median follow-up was 20.5 months. One-year event-free and overall survival were 58\% and 77\%, justifying further studies to estimate long-term clinical benefit. No dose significantly affected DNA global methylation.
CONCLUSIONS: Azacitidine at 32 mg/m2 given for 5 days is safe and can be administered after allogeneic transplant for at least 4 cycles to heavily pretreated AML/MDS patients. The trial also suggested that this treatment may prolong event-free and overall survival, and that more cycles may be associated with greater benefit.},

From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations.

	abstract = {The Kalman Filter (KF) is one of the most widely used methods for tracking and estimation due to its simplicity, optimality, tractability and robustness. However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems can be difficult. The most common approach is to use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which simply linearizes all nonlinear models so that the traditional linear Kalman filter can be applied. Although the EKF (in its many forms) is a widely used filtering strategy, over thirty years of experience with it has led to a general consensus within the tracking and control community that it is difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems which are almost linear on the time scale of the update intervals. In this paper a new linear estimator is developed and demonstrated. Using the principle that a set of discretely sampled points can be used to parameterize mean and covariance, the estimator yields performance equivalent to the KF for linear systems yet generalizes elegantly to nonlinear systems without the linearization steps required by the EKF. We show analytically that the expected performance of the new approach is superior to that of the EKF and, in fact, is directly comparable to that of the second order Gauss filter. The method is not restricted to assuming that the distributions of noise sources are Gaussian. We argue that the ease of implementation and more accurate estimation features of the new filter recommend its use over the EKF in virtually all applications.},

	doi = {10.1177/1740774514529848},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditionally, the purpose of a dose-finding design in cancer is to find the maximum tolerated dose based solely on toxicity. However, for molecularly targeted agents, little toxicity may arise within the therapeutic dose range and the dose-response curves may not be monotonic. This challenges the principle that more is better, which is widely accepted for conventional chemotherapy.
METHODS: We propose three adaptive dose-finding designs for trials evaluating molecularly targeted agents, for which the dose-response curves are unimodal or plateaued. The goal of these designs is to find the optimal biological dose, which is defined as the lowest dose with the highest rate of efficacy while safe. The first proposed design is parametric and assumes a logistic dose-efficacy curve for dose finding, the second design is nonparametric and uses the isotonic regression to identify the optimal biological dose, and the third design has the spirit of a 'semiparametric' approach by assuming a logistic model only locally around the current dose.
RESULTS: We conducted extensive simulation studies to investigate the operating characteristics of the proposed designs. Simulation studies show that the nonparametric and semiparametric designs have good operating characteristics for finding the optimal biological dose.
LIMITATIONS: The proposed designs assume a binary endpoint. Extension of the proposed designs to ordinal and time-to-event endpoints is worth further investigation.
CONCLUSION: Among the three proposed designs, the nonparametric and semiparametric designs yield consistently good operating characteristics and thus are recommended for practical use. The software to implement these two designs is available for free download at http://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/{\textasciitilde}yyuan/.},

Principles of systems pharmacology can be applied to drug design and, ultimately, testing in human clinical trials. Rather than focusing exclusively on single drug targets, systems pharmacology examines the holistic response of a phenotype-dependent pathway or pathways to drug perturbation. Knowledge of individual pharmacogenetic profiles further modulates the responses to these drug perturbations, moving the field toward more individualized ('personalized') drug development. The speed with which the information required to assess these system responses and their genomic underpinnings is changing and the importance of identifying the optimal drug or drug combinations for maximal benefit and minimal risk require that clinical trial design strategies be adaptable.

This is a situation in which, for either group, we have little or almost no knowledge about which of the available dose levels will correspond to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), but we may have quite strong knowledge concerning which of the two groups will have the higher level of MTD, if indeed they do not have the same MTD. The motivation for studying this problem came from an investigation into a new therapy for acute leukemia in children. The background to this study is discussed. There were two groups of patients: one group already received heavy prior therapy while the second group had received relatively much lighter prior therapy. It was therefore anticipated that the second group would have an MTD higher or at least as high as the first. Generally, likelihood methods or, equivalently, the use of noninformative Bayes priors, can be used to model the main aspects of the study, i.e., the MTD for one of the groups, reserving more informative Bayes modeling to be applied to the secondary features of the study. These secondary features may simply be the direction of the difference between the MTD levels for the two groups or, possibly, information on the potential gap between the two MTDs.},

The use of Bayesian techniques, in particular in the design and interpretation of clinical trials, offers several substantial advantages over the classical statistical approach. First, in contrast to classical statistics, Bayesian analysis allows a direct statement regarding the probability that a treatment was beneficial. Second, Bayesian statistics allow the researcher to incorporate any prior information in the analysis of the experimental results. Third, Bayesian methods can efficiently handle complex statistical models, which are suited for advanced clinical trial designs. Finally, Bayesian statistics encourage a thorough consideration and presentation of the assumptions underlying an analysis, which enables the reader to fully appraise the authors' conclusions. Both Bayesian and classical statistics have their respective strengths and limitations and should be viewed as being complementary to each other; we do not attempt to make a head-to-head comparison, as this is beyond the scope of the present review. Rather, the objective of the present article is to provide a nonmathematical, reader-friendly overview of the current practice of Bayesian statistics coupled with numerous intuitive examples from the field of oncology. It is hoped that this educational review will be a useful resource to the oncologist and result in a better understanding of the scope, strengths, and limitations of the Bayesian approach.},

	abstract = {Cancer refers to a set of diseases where normal cells of the body lose mechanisms which are responsible for controlling their growth and motility. Chemotherapy aims to kill these abnormal or cancer cells, however normal cells and healthy tissues are also adversely affected. Systematic modelling and optimization approaches can be employed to obtain effective chemotherapeutic protocol that minimizes the tumour cell population while limiting the damage to the normal cells. In this paper, two models for cancer chemotherapy are considered and the effect of the time of drug administration on the final tumour size is analyzed. The first model is cell cycle non-specific and considers all the cancer cells as belonging to one compartment whereas the second model is cell cycle specific and takes into account the effect of the drugs that act on cells at certain specific stages of the cell cycle. An optimal control problem is also formulated and solved for both the models so as to obtain the chemotherapeutic schedule which minimizes the final tumour size while taking into account the constraints on drug resistance and toxicity. For the first model a mixed integer dynamic optimization problem and for the second model a dynamic optimization problem are solved. The optimal chemotherapeutic drug administration profiles and the variation of number of cells with time are obtained and analyzed in detail.},

	abstract = {The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a computational technique for approximate inference in state-space models. In typical applications, the state vectors are large spatial fields that are observed sequentially over time. The EnKF approximates the Kalman filter by representing the distribution of the state with an ensemble of draws from that distribution. The ensemble members are updated based on newly available data by shifting instead of reweighting, which allows the EnKF to avoid the degeneracy problems of reweighting-based algorithms. Taken together, the ensemble representation and shifting-based updates make the EnKF computationally feasible even for extremely high-dimensional state spaces. The EnKF is successfully used in data-assimilation applications with tens of millions of dimensions. While it implicitly assumes a linear Gaussian state-space model, it has also turned out to be remarkably robust to deviations from these assumptions in many applications. Despite its successes, the EnKF is largely unknown in the statistics community. We aim to change that with the present article, and to entice more statisticians to work on this topic.},

Such failures may be caused by the absence of an effect and also if a suboptimal dose is being tested. It is thus important to consider how to optimise the choice of dose or doses that continue into the confirmatory phase. For many indications, it is common to test one single active dose in phase III. However, phase IIB dose-finding trials are relatively small and often lack the ability of precisely estimating the dose-response curves for efficacy and tolerability. Because of this uncertainty in dose response, it is reasonable to consider bringing more than one dose into phase III. Using simple but illustrative models, we find the optimal doses and compare the probability of success, for fixed total sample sizes, when one or two active doses are included in phase III.},

Many exposure-response model structures have been proposed for cardiovascular (CV) safety markers, but few studies have compared models across multiple drugs. To recommend preferred drug-effect exposure-response models on vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG) intervals, an individual-level model-based meta-analysis (39 studies and 1,291 subjects) compared 90 model structures. Models were selected to describe the data and cross-validate studies on the same drug. The most commonly selected baseline model was an unstructured model (estimation of a value at each study nominal time) for all measures but blood pressure. The unstructured model estimated a better cross-validated drug-effect when considering all markers. A linear model was the most commonly selected to characterize drug-effect on all markers. We propose these models as a starting point assisting with CV safety exposure-response assessment in nondedicated small studies with healthy subjects.},

	abstract = {Multiple Bayesian adaptive designs have been proposed for Phase I clinical trials since the continual reassessment method (CRM) was proposed by O’Quigley et al. (1990). Focused on dose-finding in the setting cancer chemotherapies, the CRM seeks to allocate new patients to the posterior estimate of a maximum tolerable dose (MTD). Later, Whitehead and Brunier (1995) applied Bayesian decision theory to maximize statistical information for the MTD when allocating a new patients to an experimental dose. The two allocation rules reflect conflicting perspectives of dose-finding trials. The CRM emphasizes individual-level or current trial participant ethics, while the method of Whitehead and Brunier (1995) emphasizes population-level ethics concerned with treating future patients at the most precise estimate possible. In the design of a Phase I dose-finding trial to investigate hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) we sought to compromise these existing approaches to emphasize individual-level ethics while increasing the precision of the resulting MTD estimate. To this end, we propose a novel dose allocation design referred to as the balanced information gain method (BIGM). We first decompose the loss function used by Whitehead and Brunier (1995) then modify the loss function with a tuning parameter that allows a trialist to di↵erentially weigh individual- and population-level ethics to meet the necessary goals of their particular clinical setting. Simulation studies show that the proposed BIGM provides a reasonable compromise between the distribution of the estimated MTD and the distribution of the number of observed adverse events per trial when compared to the two methods with the marginal perspectives.},

Pre-existing T-cell infiltration and/or the presence of PD-L1 in tumours may be used as indicators of clinical response; however, blood-based profiling to understand the mechanisms of PD-1 blockade has not been widely explored. Here we use immune profiling of peripheral blood from patients with stage IV melanoma before and after treatment with the PD-1-targeting antibody pembrolizumab and identify pharmacodynamic changes in circulating exhausted-phenotype CD8 T cells (Tex cells). Most of the patients demonstrated an immunological response to pembrolizumab. Clinical failure in many patients was not solely due to an inability to induce immune reinvigoration, but rather resulted from an imbalance between T-cell reinvigoration and tumour burden. The magnitude of reinvigoration of circulating Tex cells determined in relation to pretreatment tumour burden correlated with clinical response. By focused profiling of a mechanistically relevant circulating T-cell subpopulation calibrated to pretreatment disease burden, we identify a clinically accessible potential on-treatment predictor of response to PD-1 blockade.},

	abstract = {Purpose Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -targeted monoclonal antibodies, and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate that combines the properties of trastuzumab with the cytotoxic activity of DM1. T-DM1 demonstrated encouraging efficacy and safety in a phase II study of patients with previously untreated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Combination T-DM1 and pertuzumab showed synergistic activity in cell culture models and had an acceptable safety profile in a phase Ib and II study. Methods In the MARIANNE study, 1,095 patients with centrally assessed, HER2-positive, advanced breast cancer and no prior therapy for advanced disease were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to control (trastuzumab plus taxane), T-DM1 plus placebo, hereafter T-DM1, or T-DM1 plus pertuzumab at standard doses. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by independent review. Results T-DM1 and T-DM1 plus pertuzumab showed noninferior PFS compared with trastuzumab plus taxane (median PFS: 13.7 months with trastuzumab plus taxane, 14.1 months with T-DM1, and 15.2 months with T-DM1 plus pertuzumab). Neither experimental arm showed PFS superiority to trastuzumab plus taxane. Response rate was 67.9\% in patients who were treated with trastuzumab plus taxane, 59.7\% with T-DM1, and 64.2\% with T-DM1 plus pertuzumab; median response duration was 12.5 months, 20.7 months, and 21.2 months, respectively. The incidence of grade ≥ 3 adverse events was numerically higher in the control arm (54.1\%) versus the T-DM1 arm (45.4\%) and T-DM1 plus pertuzumab arm (46.2\%). Numerically fewer patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events in the T-DM1 arms, and health-related quality of life was maintained for longer in the T-DM1 arms. Conclusion T-DM1 showed noninferior, but not superior, efficacy and better tolerability than did taxane plus trastuzumab for first-line treatment of HER2-positive, advanced breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Background An evolving understanding of the immunopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis suggests that depleting B cells could be useful for treatment. We studied ocrelizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively depletes CD20-expressing B cells, in the primary progressive form of the disease. Methods In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 732 patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis in a 2:1 ratio to receive intravenous ocrelizumab (600 mg) or placebo every 24 weeks for at least 120 weeks and until a prespecified number of confirmed disability progression events had occurred. The primary end point was the percentage of patients with disability progression confirmed at 12 weeks in a time-to-event analysis. Results The percentage of patients with 12-week confirmed disability progression was 32.9\% with ocrelizumab versus 39.3\% with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.59 to 0.98; P=0.03). The percentage of patients with 24-week confirmed disability progression was 29.6\% with ocrelizumab versus 35.7\% with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.58 to 0.98; P=0.04). By week 120, performance on the timed 25-foot walk worsened by 38.9\% with ocrelizumab versus 55.1\% with placebo (P=0.04); the total volume of brain lesions on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) decreased by 3.4\% with ocrelizumab and increased by 7.4\% with placebo (P{\textless}0.001); and the percentage of brain-volume loss was 0.90\% with ocrelizumab versus 1.09\% with placebo (P=0.02). There was no significant difference in the change in the Physical Component Summary score of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. Infusion-related reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, and oral herpes infections were more frequent with ocrelizumab than with placebo. Neoplasms occurred in 2.3\% of patients who received ocrelizumab and in 0.8\% of patients who received placebo; there was no clinically significant difference between groups in the rates of serious adverse events and serious infections. Conclusions Among patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, ocrelizumab was associated with lower rates of clinical and MRI progression than placebo. Extended observation is required to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of ocrelizumab. (Funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche; ORATORIO ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01194570 .).},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Cabazitaxel has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment (HI). This phase I study assessed cabazitaxel safety and pharmacokinetics in patients with HI.
METHODS: Patients with advanced, non-hematologic cancer, and normal hepatic function (Cohort 1: C-1), or mild (C-2), moderate (C-3), severe (C-4) HI received cabazitaxel starting doses of 25, 20, 10, and 10 mg/m(2), respectively. Doses were escalated in patients with HI based on Cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Adverse events and the cabazitaxel pharmacokinetic profile were assessed.
RESULTS: In C-2, three patients receiving cabazitaxel 25 mg/m(2) experienced DLTs; maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 20 mg/m(2). In C-3, two patients receiving 20 mg/m(2) experienced DLTs; MTD was 15 mg/m(2). C-4 was discontinued early due to DLTs. The most frequent cabazitaxel-related, grade 3-4 toxicity was neutropenia (42\%). Cabazitaxel clearance normalized to body surface area (CL/BSA) was lower in C-1 (geometric mean [GM] 13.4 L/h/m(2)) than expected (26.4 L/h/m(2)), but similar in C-2 (23.5 L/h/m(2)) and C-3 (27.9 L/h/m(2)). CL/BSA in C-4 was 18.1 L/h/m(2). Compared with C-2, CL/BSA increased 19\% in C-3 (GM ratio 1.19; 90\% CI 0.74-1.91), but decreased 23\% in C-4 (0.77; 0.39-1.53). Cabazitaxel free fraction was unaltered. No significant correlation was found between grade 3-4 toxicities and pharmacokinetic parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Mild-moderate HI did not cause substantial decline in cabazitaxel clearance. Cabazitaxel dose reductions in patients with mild-moderate HI, and a contraindication in patients with severe HI, are justified based on safety data.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV). Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations.
RESULTS: Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled. In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy. At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations. An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population. Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab. The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo.
CONCLUSION: Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations. MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting. The Oncologist 2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study. Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types. Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor. MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker. It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is the standard of care for first-line treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer, there is no established therapy in the second-line setting. In GATSBY, we examined the efficacy and tolerability of trastuzumab emtansine in patients previously treated for HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer (unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic gastric cancer, including adenocarcinoma of the gastro-oesophageal junction).
METHODS: This is the final analysis from GATSBY, a randomised, open-label, adaptive, phase 2/3 study, done at 107 centres (28 countries worldwide). Eligible patients had HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer and progressed during or after first-line therapy. In stage one of the trial, patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (2:2:1) to receive intravenous trastuzumab emtansine (3·6 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 2·4 mg/kg weekly) or physician's choice of a taxane (intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or intravenous paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) weekly). In stage two, patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (2:1) to receive the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC)-selected dose of trastuzumab emtansine (2·4 mg/kg weekly) or a taxane (same regimen as above). We used permuted block randomisation, stratified by world region, previous HER2-targeted therapy, and previous gastrectomy. The primary endpoint (overall survival) was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01641939.
FINDINGS: Between Sept 3, 2012, and Oct 14, 2013, 70 patients were assigned to receive trastuzumab emtansine 3·6 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 75 to receive trastuzumab emtansine 2·4 mg/kg weekly, and 37 to receive a taxane in the stage 1 part of the trial. At the pre-planned interim analysis (Oct 14, 2013), the IDMC selected trastuzumab emtansine 2·4 mg/kg weekly as the dose to proceed to stage 2. By Feb 9, 2015, a further 153 patients had been randomly assigned to receive trastuzumab emtansine 2·4 mg/kg weekly and a further 80 to receive a taxane. At data cutoff, median follow-up was 17·5 months (IQR 12·1-23·0) for the trastuzumab emtansine 2·4 mg/kg weekly group and 15·4 months (9·2-18·1) in the taxane group. Median overall survival was 7·9 months (95\% CI 6·7-9·5) with trastuzumab emtansine 2·4 mg/kg weekly and 8·6 months (7·1-11·2) with taxane treatment (hazard ratio 1·15, 95\% CI 0·87-1·51, one-sided p=0·86). The trastuzumab emtansine 2·4 mg/kg group had lower incidences of grade 3 or more adverse events (134 [60\%] of 224 patients treated with trastuzumab emtansine vs 78 [70\%] of 111 patients treated with a taxane), and similar incidences of adverse events leading to death (eight [4\%] vs four [4\%]), serious adverse events (65 [29\%] vs 31 [28\%]), and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (31 [14\%] vs 15 [14\%]) than did taxane treatment. The most common grade 3 or more adverse events in the trastuzumab emtansine 2·4 mg/kg weekly group were anaemia (59 [26\%]) and thrombocytopenia (25 [11\%]) compared with neutropenia (43 [39\%]), and anaemia (20 [18\%]), in the taxane group. The most common serious adverse events were anaemia (eight [4\%]), upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (eight [4\%]), pneumonia (seven [3\%]), gastric haemorrhage (six [3\%]), and gastrointestinal haemorrhage (five [2\%]) in the trastuzumab emtansine 2·4 mg/kg weekly group compared with pneumonia (four [4\%]), febrile neutropenia (four [4\%]), anaemia (three [3\%]), and neutropenia (three [3\%]) in the taxane group.
INTERPRETATION: Trastuzumab emtansine was not superior to taxane in patients with previously treated, HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer. There is still an unmet need in this patient group and therapeutic options remain limited.

This guideline describes a standard approach to solid tumour measurements and definitions for objective change in tumour size for use in trials in which an immunotherapy is used. Additionally, it defines the minimum datapoints required from future trials and those currently in development to facilitate the compilation of a data warehouse to use to later validate iRECIST. An unprecedented number of trials have been done, initiated, or are planned to test new immune modulators for cancer therapy using a variety of modified response criteria.

Thirty-four patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors were treated (phase I study, modified 3+3 dose escalation; 5 cohorts; 3-16 mg taselisib once daily capsule). Taselisib pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional; mean half-life was 40 hours. Frequent dose-dependent, treatment-related adverse events included diarrhea, hyperglycemia, decreased appetite, nausea, rash, stomatitis, and vomiting. At 12 and 16 mg dose levels, dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were observed, with an accumulation of higher-grade adverse events after the cycle 1 DLT assessment window. Pharmacodynamic findings showed pathway inhibition at ≥3 mg in patient tumor samples, consistent with preclinical PIK3CA-mutant tumor xenograft models. Confirmed response rate was 36\% for PIK3CA-mutant tumor patients with measurable disease (5/14: 4 breast cancer, [3 patients at 12 mg]; 1 NSCLC) where responses started at 3 mg, and 0\% in patients with tumors without known PIK3CA hotspot mutations (0/15).},

Partial purification of the enzyme was accomplished through disc-gel electrophoresis on polyacrylamide in the presence of 0.25\% positively charged detergents like cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. An alkaline protease (pH 7.4) with properties similar to those of the erythrocyte enzyme was found in leucocytes. The similarity between the properties of the leucocytic and erythrocytic proteases and the correlation of the activity in erythrocyte membranes with content of white cells in these preparations, suggest that enzymatic activities in the contaminating leucocytes are responsible for the activity of membraneous proteases in erythrocytes.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of a series of 475 patients with advanced breast cancer enrolled in two randomised trials, who received first-line chemotherapy. The impact of severe (grade 3 or 4) hematological toxicity on survival and time to disease progression was assessed.
RESULTS: When severe myelotoxicity was evaluated as a whole, a significant negative association for time to disease progression and a trend for a worse survival were demonstrated. In multivariate analysis, hematological toxicity retained its significance as an independent negative prognostic factor for time to disease progression.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, and myelosuppression is a common side-effect. We aimed to assess whether haematological toxic effects could be a biological measure of drug activity and a marker of efficacy.
METHODS: We analysed data for 1265 patients who received chemotherapy (vinorelbine, gemcitabine, gemcitabine and vinorelbine, cisplatin and vinorelbine, or cisplatin and gemcitabine) within three randomised trials. Primary landmark analyses were restricted to 436 patients who received all six planned chemotherapy cycles and who were alive 180 days after randomisation. Neutropenia was categorised on the basis of worst WHO grade during chemotherapy: absent (grade 0), mild (grade 1-2), or severe (grade 3-4). All statistical analyses were stratified by treatment allocation. Analyses were repeated in the out-of-landmark group (829 patients), stratifying by treatment allocation and number of chemotherapy cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival.
FINDINGS: In the landmark group, hazard ratios of death were 0.65 (0.46-0.93) for patients with severe neutropenia and 0.74 (0.56-0.98) for those with mild neutropenia. Median survival after the landmark time of 180 days was 31.4 weeks (95\% CI 25.7-39.6) for patients without neutropenia compared with 42.0 weeks (32.7-59.7) for patients with severe neutropenia, and with 43.7 weeks (36.6-66.0) for those with mild neutropenia (severe vs mild vs no neutropenia p=0.0118). Findings were much the same for the out-of-landmark group.
INTERPRETATION: Neutropenia during chemotherapy is associated with increased survival of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, and its absence might be a result of underdosing. Prospective trials are needed to assess whether drug dosing guided by the occurrence of toxic effects could improve efficacy of standard regimens.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Front-line docetaxel-gemcitabine (DG) combination represents an alternative to platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. One of its more common side effects is neutropenia. The association between the grade of DG-induced neutropenia and the clinical outcome was analyzed.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight hundred fifty-eight patients with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC, treated with front-line DG were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were categorized into three groups according to the presented worst neutropenia grade: absent (grade 0), mild (grades I/II) and severe (grades III/IV).
RESULTS: Response rate, median time to tumor progression (TTP) and median overall survival (OS) were significantly better in patients developing any grade of neutropenia compared with those without neutropenia. The median TTPs were 3.0, 5.4 and 5.6 months for the groups with absent, mild and severe neutropenia, respectively; the median OSs were 7.9, 12.5 and 11.2 months for the same groups, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that both mild and severe chemotherapy-induced neutropenia were independent factors associated with a better TTP and OS survival.
CONCLUSION: Although DG-induced neutropenia was emerged as an independent prognostic factor, it remains to be demonstrated in prospective studies that dose escalation of chemotherapy drugs in patients who do not develop neutropenia may improve the clinical efficacy.},

	abstract = {Body surface area-dosing does not account for the complex processes of cytotoxic drug elimination. This leads to an unpredictable variation in effect. Overdosing is easily recognised but it is possible that unrecognised underdosing is more common and may occur in 30\% or more of patients receiving standard regimen. Those patients who are inadvertently underdosed are at risk of a significantly reduced anticancer effect. Using published data, it can be calculated that there is an almost 20\% relative reduction in survival for women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer as a result of unrecognised underdosing. Similarly, the cure rate of cisplatin-based chemotherapy for advanced testicular cancer may be reduced by as much as 10\%. The inaccuracy of body surface area-dosing is more than an inconvenience and it is important that methods for more accurate dose calculation are determined, based on the known drug elimination processes for cytotoxic chemotherapy. Twelve rules for dose calculation of chemotherapy are given that can be used as a guideline until better dose-calculation methods become available. Consideration should be given to using fixed dose guidelines independent of body surface area and based on drug elimination capability, both as a starting dose and for dose adjustment, which may have accuracy, safety and financial advantages.},

We evaluated the prognostic implications of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in advanced gastric carcinoma. Data from a prospective survey of oral fluoropyrimidine S-1 for advanced gastric cancer patients in Japan were reviewed. We identified 1055 untreated patients with adequate baseline bone marrow function. During treatment with S-1, a total of 293 (28\%) patients experienced grade 1 or higher neutropenia. The adjusted hazard ratio of death for the presence of neutropenia, as compared with the absence of such toxicity, from a multivariate Cox model was 0.72 (95\% confidence interval, 0.54–0.95; P=0.0189) for grade 1 neutropenia, 0.63 (0.50–0.78; P{\textless}0.0001) for grade 2 neutropenia and 0.71 (0.51–0.98; P=0.0388) for grade 3–4 neutropenia. These findings suggest that the occurrence of neutropenia during chemotherapy is an independent predictor of increased survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer, whereas the absence of such toxicity indicates that the dosages of drugs are not pharmacologically adequate.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic significance of adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy-induced neutropenia with survival in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix.
METHODS: Data from 107 patients with stage IB-IIB cervical cancer were retrospectively analyzed. The median follow-up was 37.5 (4.2-72.7) months. All patients had received radical surgery, including pelvic lymphadenectomy, followed by paclitaxel plus carboplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Relative neutropenia, defined as an absolute neutrophil count {\textless}1,000/mm(3) at the concurrent chemoradiotherapy cycle nadir, correlated to the pathologic findings and survival outcomes.
RESULTS: Sixty-six patients experienced neutropenia at least once during concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and demonstrated marginal improvement in disease-free survival (p=0.055), although not in overall survival. By subgroup analyses, the gain of disease free survival mainly originated from the node metastasis subgroup (p=0.033). Treatment-induced neutropenia proved to be the only significant independent factor for recurrence in cervical cancer (p=0.042) by multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy-induced neutropenia may be a prognostic factor of recurrence in patients with cervical cancer. Individualized dose titration of the tolerable myelosuppression might be beneficial.},

	doi = {10.1200/JOP.2010.000045},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Clinicians typically cap an obese patient's chemotherapy regimen as a result of concern for excessive toxicity, without adequate clinical evidence. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression in obese patients versus nonobese patients with capped dosing on the basis of body surface area (BSA).
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted comparing obese patients (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) with capped dosing who received capped chemotherapy doses at a BSA of 2.2 m(2) with nonobese (BMI {\textless} 25 kg/m(2)) patients with lung, colorectal, or hormone-refractory prostate cancer.
RESULTS: Forty-one obese patients with capped dosing and 244 nonobese patients were included. The obese patient group received on average significantly more cycles of chemotherapy (6 v 4 cycles) compared with the nonobese group. The overall incidence of any chemotherapy-related toxicity was 34\% in the obese patient group, compared with 42\% in the nonobese patient group (P = .356). The incidence of grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was lower, but not statistically significant, in obese patients with capped dosing compared with the nonobese patient group (22\% v 27\%; P = .493).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, obese patients with capped dosing experienced a lower incidence of severe myelosuppression and tolerated more cycles of chemotherapy compared with nonobese patients. The better tolerability of chemotherapy in obese patients with capped dosing suggests that there is room to increase the dose in obese patients above the nationally recognized BSA cap of 2.0 m(2), especially in early-stage lung or colon cancers in which the intention of treatment is curative.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We assess the prognostic value of chemotherapy-induced leukopenia and sensory neuropathy in the CALYPSO trial patients treated with carboplatin-paclitaxel (CP) or carboplatin-liposomal doxorubicin (CPLD).
METHODS: We performed a landmark analysis at first month after randomisation to correlate leukopenia (nadir white blood cell {\textless}4.0 × 10(9) per litre or severe infection) during cycle 1 of chemotherapy with progression-free survival (PFS). Using time-dependent proportional-hazards models, we also investigated the association between neuropathy and PFS.
RESULTS: Of 608 patients with nadir blood and did not receive growth factors, 72\% (CP=70\%, CPLD=73\%) had leukopenia. Leukopenia was prognostic for PFS in those receiving CP (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.66, P=0.01). Carboplatin-liposomal doxorubicin was more effective than CP in patients without leukopenia (aHR 0.51, P=0.001), but not those experiencing leukopenia (aHR 0.93, P=0.54; interaction P=0.008).Of 949 patients, 32\% (CP=62\%, CPLD=28\%) reported neuropathy during landmark. Neuropathy was prognostic for PFS in the CP group only (aHR 0.77, P=0.02). Carboplatin-liposomal doxorubicin appeared to be more effective than CP among patients without neuropathy (aHR 0.70, P{\textless}0.0001), but not those with neuropathy (aHR 0.96, P=0.81; interaction P=0.15).
CONCLUSION: First-cycle leukopenia and neuropathy were prognostic for patients treated with CP. Efficacy of CP treatment was similar to CPLD in patients who developed leukopenia. These findings support further research to understand the mechanisms of treatment-related toxicity.},

We aimed to determine whether toxicity was related to survival and histological response in high-grade localised extremity osteosarcoma. We undertook a retrospective analysis of patients treated within three consecutive randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the European Osteosarcoma Intergroup.
METHODS: Between 1982 and 2002, 533 patients were randomised to six cycles of doxorubicin 75 mg/m(2) and cisplatin 100 mg/m(2). Toxicity data were collected prospectively and graded according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria. Standard univariate and multivariate models were constructed to examine the relationship between reported toxicity, survival, and histological response.
RESULTS: Five- and 10-year overall survival was 57\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 52-61\%) and 53\% (49-58\%), respectively. Grades 3-4 oral mucositis (hazard ratio (HR) 0.51, 95\% CI 0.29-0.91), grades 1-2 nausea/vomiting (HR 0.37, 95\% CI 0.16-0.85), grades 1-2 thrombocytopenia (HR 0.49, 95\% CI 0.27-0.87), good histological response (HR 0.42, 95\% CI 0.27-0.65), and distal tumour site (HR 0.45, 95\% CI 0.28-0.71) were associated with improved survival in multivariate analysis. The only factors that were independently associated with histological response were older age (odds ratio (OR) 0.18, 95\% CI 0.04-0.72) and chondroblastic tumour (OR 0.28, 95\% CI 0.10-0.77), both being associated with a significantly lower chance of achieving a good response.
CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy-induced toxicity predicts survival in patients with localised extremity osteosarcoma. Investigation of the pharmacogenomic mechanisms of constitutional chemosensitivity underlying these observations will present opportunities for personalising treatment and could lead to improved outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), and leukopenia is a common side effect. This study assesses whether chemotherapy-induced leukopenia is a predictor of efficacy and whether it is associated with the survival of SCLC patients.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on data from 445 patients with SCLC who received standard chemotherapy for 4 to 10 cycles. The World Health Organization grading system classifies leukopenia during chemotherapy as follows: absent (grade 0), mild (grades 1 and 2), or severe (grades 3 and 4). The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: The association between chemotherapy-induced leukopenia and OS was assessed. According to a multivariate Cox model with time-varying covariates, the hazard ratio of death was significantly lower among patients with mild leukopenia than among patients with severe leukopenia at 0.687 (0.506 to 0.943) and 1.414 (1.147 to 1.744), respectively. The median survival was 13 months (95\% CI: 11 to 15 months) for patients who did not experience leukopenia, 17 months (95\% CI: 14 to 18 months) for those with mild leukopenia, and 14 months (95\% CI: 13 to 16 months) for those with severe leukopenia (absent vs. mild vs. severe leukopenia, P=0.047).
CONCLUSION: Leukopenia during chemotherapy is associated with the survival of SCLC patients. Mild leukopenia is strongly associated with longer survival time.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation has been recognized to foster tumour development. Whether chemotherapy can be used to neutralize chronic inflammation is unclear.
METHODS: We evaluated baseline and nadir neutrophils in 111 patients (pts.) with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 118 pts. with ovarian cancer (OC) treated with chemotherapy administered with dose-individualization to achieve nadir neutropenia of 1.5. We used predefined baseline neutrophil cut-offs 4.5 × 109/L (NSCLC) and 3.9 × 109/L (OC).
RESULTS: Absence of chemotherapy-induced nadir neutropenia (CTCAE grade 0, neutrophils ≥ LLN) was seen in 23\% of OC and 25\% of NSCLC pts. Absence of nadir neutropenia was associated with decreased overall survival (OS) compared with presence ({\textgreater}grade 0) of neutropenia (9 vs. 14 months, P=0.004 for NSCLC and 23 vs. 56 months; P=0.01 for OC). Obtaining grade 3/4 neutropenia did not improve survival compared with grade 1/2 neutropenia. In multivariate analyses, baseline neutrophils ≥ 4.5 × 109/L (HR: 2.0; 95\% CI: 1.11-3.44;P = 0.02) and absence of nadir neutropenia (HR: 1.6; 95\% CI: 1.02-2.65;P = 0.04) for NSCLC and absence of nadir neutropenia (HR: 1.7; 95\% CI: 1.04;2.93;P = 0.04) for OC were independently associated with short OS.
CONCLUSIONS: A neutrophil index comprising elevated baseline neutrophils and absence of neutropenia identified a high risk group of NSCLC and ovarian cancer patients with only modest effect of chemotherapy. New treatment options for this subset of patients are required.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This randomised phase II trial compared dose-escalated weekly paclitaxel (wPTX) vs standard-dose wPTX for patients with previously treated advanced gastric cancer (AGC).
METHODS: Ninety patients were randomised to a standard dose of wPTX (80 mg m(-2)) or an escalated dose of wPTX (80-120 mg m(-2)) to assess the superiority of overall survival (OS) with a one-sided alpha error of 0.3 and a power of 0.8.
RESULTS: The median OS showed a trend towards longer survival in the dose-escalated arm (11.8 vs 9.6 months; hazard ratio (HR), 0.75; one-sided P=0.12), although it was statistically not significant. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer in the dose-escalated arm (4.3 vs 2.5 months, HR, 0.55; P=0.017). Objective response rate was 30.3\% with dose escalation and 17.1\% with standard dose (P=0.2). The frequency of all grades of neutropenia was significantly higher with dose escalation (88.7\% vs 60.0\%, P=0.002); however, no significant difference was observed in the proportion of patients experiencing grade 3 or more (40.9\% vs 31.1\%, P=0.34).
CONCLUSION: Dose-escalated wPTX in patients with pretreated AGC met our predefined threshold of primary end point, OS (P{\textless}0.3); however, it did not show a significantly longer OS. Progression-free survival was significantly better with dose escalation.},

UDP-N-acetyl-α-D-galactosamine:polypeptide N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase 14 (GALNT14) genotype was previously identified as a prognostic marker for HCC patients receiving 5-fluorouracil, mitoxantrone and cisplatin (FMP) combination chemotherapy. The present study aimed to assess clinical parameters and on-treatment side effects as effective predictors for favorable prognosis. A total of 118 patients with HCC receiving split-dose FMP were retrospectively enrolled. The clinical parameters, side effects and GALNT14 genotype were analyzed. The independent predictors for time-to-progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Following categorization, the Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare survival outcomes. Pretreatment α-fetoprotein (AFP) ≤2,800 ng/ml (median level), GALNT14 'TT' genotype, on-treatment leukopenia and absence of vomiting were identified as independent predictors of a favorable TTP (P=0.001, 0.035, 0.008 and 0.009, respectively) and OS (P=0.028, 0.006, 0.027 and 0.013, respectively). A total of 59 patients with AFP ≤2,800 ng/ml exhibited longer median TTP and OS (3.11 vs. 1.75 months, P{\textless}0.001; and 8.14 vs. 3.79 months, P{\textless}0.001, respectively). A total of 30 patients with the GALNT14 'TT' genotype exhibited longer median TTP and OS (3.11 vs. 2.11 months, P=0.014; and 5.75 vs. 3.93 months, P=0.001, respectively). Finally, 9 patients (9/118; 7.6\%) with all four favorable factors exhibited the longest median TTP and OS (10.64 vs. 2.07 months, P=0.002; and 25.50 vs. 4.50 months, P{\textless}0.001, respectively). In conclusion, the AFP level and the GALNT genotype may be considered as pre-therapeutic predictors of a favorable response.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whether or not toxicity predicts clinical outcomes has long been a question regarding cancer treatments. While prior studies have focused on specific cancers, therapies, and toxicities, no comprehensive evidence exists on whether treatment toxicity predicts favorable outcomes.
METHODS: We abstracted treatment toxicity and clinical outcome data from a sample of phase III oncology randomized clinical trials (n = 99 trials). We investigated whether treatments with relatively greater toxicity compared with their controls had relatively higher, lower, or equivocal rates of clinical efficacy, measured by progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Several toxicities were assessed (all grades, grades III/IV, cutaneous rash, gastrointestinal toxicity, and myelosuppression).
RESULTS: Toxicity and efficacy were greater among treatments than controls (e.g. 3.5 instances of all-grade toxicity per patient in treatment arms versus 2.8 instances in controls, P {\textless} 0.001; mean PFS of 9.1 months across treatment arms versus 7.1 months across controls, P {\textless} 0.001; mean OS of 18.6 months across treatment arms versus 16.9 months across controls, P {\textless} 0.001). Across trials, greater relative treatment toxicity was strongly associated with greater PFS in treatments versus controls (P {\textless} 0.001), but not OS (P = 0.44). Although higher relative rates of myelosuppression and cutaneous rash among treatments were not associated with greater treatment efficacy, greater relative gastrointestinal toxicity among treatments was associated with greater relative PFS compared with controls (P = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: Across trials, treatments with relatively greater all-grade toxicity compared with controls are associated with relatively greater PFS but not OS.},

Breast cancer patients planned for 3-weekly ACC were enrolled in this study. The first treatment cycle was administered in a standard BSA-adjusted dose. The absolute neutrophil count was measured at baseline and at day 8, 11 and 15 after administration of ACC. For patients with none or mild (CTC grade 0-2) neutropenia and no other dose-limiting toxicity, we performed a 10-25 \% dose escalation of the second cycle with the opportunity to a further 10-25 \% dose escalation of the third cycle. Thirty patients were treated in the adjuvant setting with either FE100C (n = 23) or AC (n = 4), or in the palliative setting with FAC (n = 3). Two out of 23 patients (9 \%) treated with FEC did not develop grade 3-4 neutropenia after the first treatment cycle. Dose escalation was performed in these two patients (30 \% in one and 15 \% in the other patient). During dose escalation, there were no complications like febrile neutropenia. No patients treated with FAC or AC could be escalated, since all of them developed grade 3-4 neutropenia. We conclude that asymptomatic grade 3-4 neutropenia is likely to be achieved in the majority of patients with breast cancer treated with ACC according to presently advocated BSA-based dose levels. Escalation of currently advocated ACC doses without G-CSF, with a target of grade 3-4 neutropenia, is feasible, but only possible in a small proportion of patients. EudraCT 2010-020309-33.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Leucopenia or neutropenia during chemotherapy predicts better survival in several cancers. We aimed to assess whether leucopenia could be a biological measure of treatment and a marker of efficacy in advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (ANPC).
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 3826 patients with ANPC who received chemoradiotherapy. Leucopenia was categorised on the basis of worst grade during treatment according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0: no leucopenia (grade 0), mild leucopenia (grade 1-2), and severe leucopenia (grade 3-4). Associations between leucopenia and survival were estimated by Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: Of the 3826 patients, 2511 (65.6 \%) developed mild leucopenia (grade 1-2) and 807 (21.1 \%) developed severe leucopenia (grade 3-4) during treatment; 508 (13.3 \%) did not. A multivariate Cox model that included leucopenia determined that the hazard ratios (HR) of death for patients with mild and severe leucopenia were 0.69 [95 \% confidence interval (95 \%CI) 0.56-0.85, p {\textless} 0.001] and 0.75 (95 \%CI 0.59-0.95, p = 0.019), respectively; the HR of distant metastasis for patients with mild and severe leucopenia were 0.77 (95 \%CI 0.61-0.96, p = 0.023) and 0.99 (95 \%CI 0.77-1.29, p = 0.995), respectively. Leucopenia had no effect on locoregional relapse.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mild leucopenia during chemoradiotherapy is associated with improved overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival in ANPC. Mild leucopenia may indicate appropriate dosage of chemotherapy. We can identify the patients who may benefit from chemotherapy if they experienced leucopenia during the treatment. Prospective trials are required to assess whether dosing adjustments based on leucopenia may improve chemotherapy efficacy.},

All patients underwent surgery and received radiotherapy to the axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes and the chest wall. The effect of leucopenia caused by CMF on distant disease-free survival (DDFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed. A low leucocyte nadir during the chemotherapy was associated with a long DDFS in univariate analysis when tested as a continuous variable (the relative risk (RR) 1.3, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.06, P = 0.02). Similarly, when the leucocyte nadir count was divided into tertiles, the patients who had the highest nadir values during the six-cycle treatment had worst outcome (RR 1.6, 95\% CI 1.07-2.5, P = 0.02). However, in a multivariate analysis only the number of affected lymph nodes, tumour size, progesterone receptor status, surgical procedure, age and adjuvant tamoxifen therapy retained prognostic significance, whereas the leucocyte nadir count did not. A low leucocyte nadir during the adjuvant CMF chemotherapy is associated with favourable DDFS and it may be a useful biological marker for chemotherapy efficacy.},

All patients had undergone radical surgery, and 148 patients were treated with post-operative radiotherapy in two randomized studies. The impact of haematological toxicity of CAFt on distant disease-free (DDFS) and overall survival (OS) was recorded. Dose intensity of all given cycles (DI), dose intensity of the two initial cycles (DI2) and total dose (TD) were calculated separately for all chemotherapy drugs and were correlated with DDFS and OS. Patients with a lower leucocyte nadir during the chemotherapy had significantly better DDFS and OS (P = 0.01 and 0.04 respectively). Dose intensity of the two first cycles also correlated significantly with DDFS (P = 0.05) in univariate but not in multivariate analysis, while the leucocyte nadir retained its prognostic value. These results indicate that the leucocyte nadir during the adjuvant chemotherapy is a biological marker of chemotherapy efficacy; this presents the possibility of establishing an optimal dose intensity for each patient.

	abstract = {There is evidence in the literature of a relationship between dose and response to adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, although published results are conflicting. We therefore retrospectively analysed the role of dose response in patients included in four adjuvant trials of the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG, formerly the Ludwig Breast Cancer Study Group (trials I, II, III and V), all using 'classical' cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF). A total of 1385 node-positive patients were treated with oral cyclophosphamide, and intravenous methotrexate plus 5-fluorouracil (CMF) for at least six 4 week courses. 1350 of these were included in 6 month landmark treatment outcome analyses. A total of 1029 patients were premenopausal, 321 were postmenopausal; 800 had one to three and 550 more than three involved axillary nodes at surgery. The median follow-up ranged from 12 years for trial V to 15 years for trials I-III. Patients were grouped according to three prospectively defined dose levels based on the percentage of the protocol prescribed dose that was actually administered (level I {\textgreater} or = 85\%, level II 65-84\%, level III {\textless} 65\%). Patients who received dose level II had a higher disease-free (P = 0.07) and overall survival (P = 0.03) than those who received a higher (level I) or lower (level III) percentage. The 10 year overall survival was 60\% for dose level II, 56\% for dose level I, 51\% for dose level III. The results were generally consistent within trial, menopausal status, and oestrogen receptor status groups. The results within nodal groups showed a large difference among the dose levels for the group with one to three positive nodes (P = 0.02), but no difference for the group with four or more positive nodes. Our results indicate that the dose-response effect remains a crucial factor in adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer. Reductions larger than 35\% in the dose administered of oral CMF adversely influenced the outcome of breast cancer patients and should be avoided. The better outcome of the intermediate dose group indicates the need to investigate other aspects involved in the cytotoxicity of adjuvant CMF chemotherapy.},

We therefore reviewed the case notes of 750 women treated over a 15-year period at The Edinburgh Cancer Centre with the same intravenous CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil) regimen, to identify patient- and treatment-related factors influencing outcome in routine practice. The actuarial 10-year survival for these women was 59.3\%, with the anticipated poorer outcome for those with more involved ipsilateral axillary nodes, higher grade and ER-negative tumours. There was no evidence that a lower delivered dose intensity or older age at presentation resulted in a poorer survival. Of particular interest was the observation that 45\% of patients who had grade 2/3 neutropenia had a 10\% absolute survival advantage over those with no neutropenia (P{\textless}0.001). This strongly suggests that some degree of neutropenia has more influence on outcome than age or delivered dose intensity.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have found a clear relationship between systemic exposure and the toxicity or (more rarely) the efficacy of anticancer agents. Moreover, the clearance of most of these drugs differs widely between patients. These findings, combined with the narrow therapeutic index of anticancer drugs, suggest that patient outcome would be improved if doses were individualised to achieve a target systemic exposure. Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) forecasting is an efficient and robust method for the optimisation of drug therapy, but its use for anticancer drugs is not yet extensive. The aim of this paper is to review the application of population pharmacokinetics and MAP to anticancer drugs and to evaluate whether and when MAP Bayesian estimation improves the clinical benefit of anticancer chemotherapy.For each drug, the relationships between pharmacokinetic variables [e.g. plasma concentration or the area under the concentration-time curve] and pharmacodynamic effects are described. Secondly, the methodologies employed are considered and, finally, the results are analysed in terms of predictive performance as well as, where possible, the impact on clinical end-points.Some studies were retrospective and intended only to evaluate individual pharmacokinetic parameter values using very few blood samples. Among the prospective trials, a few studied the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships which provided the basis for routine pharmacokinetic monitoring. Others were performed in clinical context where MAP Bayesian estimation was used to determine maximum tolerated systemic exposure (e.g. for carboplatin, topotecan, teniposide) or for pharmacokinetic monitoring (e.g. for methotrexate or platinum compounds). Indeed, its flexibility in blood sampling times makes this technique much more applicable than other limited sampling strategies. These examples demonstrate that individual dose adjustment helps manage toxicity.The performance of pharmacokinetic monitoring is linked to the methodology used at each step of its design and application. Moreover, a limitation to the use of pharmacokinetic monitoring for certain anticancer drugs has been the difficulty in obtaining pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data. Recent progress in analytical methods, as well as the development of noninvasive methods (such as positron emission tomography) for evaluating the effects of chemotherapy, will help to define pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships. Bayesian estimation is the strategy of choice for performing pharmacokinetic studies, as well as ensuring that a given patient benefits from the desired systemic exposure. Together, these methods could contribute to improving cancer chemotherapy in terms of patient outcome and survival.},

Iterated filtering algorithms maximize the likelihood function for partially observed Markov process models by solving a recursive sequence of filtering problems. We present new theoretical results pertaining to the convergence of iterated filtering algorithms implemented via sequential Monte Carlo filters. This theory complements the growing body of empirical evidence that iterated filtering algorithms provide an effective inference strategy for scientific models of nonlinear dynamic systems. The first step in our theory involves studying a new recursive approach for maximizing the likelihood function of a latent variable model, when this likelihood is evaluated via importance sampling. This leads to the consideration of an iterated importance sampling algorithm which serves as a simple special case of iterated filtering, and may have applicability in its own right.},

This study investigates associations between BCM and treatment-related toxicity in EBC patients receiving anthracyclines-taxane based chemotherapy. Experimental Design: Pretreatment computerized tomography (CT) images were evaluated for skeletal muscle area (SMA), density (SMD), and fat tissue at the 3rd lumbar vertebrae. Skeletal muscle index (SMI) (SMA/height2) and skeletal muscle gauge (SMG=SMI x SMD) were also calculated. Relative risks (RR) are reported for associations between body composition measures and toxicity outcomes, after adjustment for age and body surface area (BSA). Results:BCM were calculated for 151 patients with EBC (median age 49, range 23 to 75). Fifty patients (33\%) developed grade 3 or 4 toxicity, which was significantly higher in those with low SMI (RR=1.29, p=0.002), low SMG (RR=1.09, p=0.01), and low LBM (RR=1.48, p=.002). ROC analysis showed the SMG measure to be the best predictor of grade 3 and 4 toxicity. Dividing SMG into tertiles showed toxicity rates of 46\%, and 22\% for lowest versus highest tertile, respectively (p=0.005). After adjusting for age and BSA, low SMG ({\textless}1475 units) was significantly associated with hematological (RR=2.12, p=0.02), gastrointestinal grade 3-4 toxicities (RR=6.49, p=0.02), and hospitalizations (RR=1.91, p=0.05). Conclusions:Poor BCM are significantly associated with increased treatment-related toxicities. Further studies are needed to investigate how these metrics can be used to more precisely dose chemotherapy to reduce treatment related toxicity while maintaining efficacy.},

Perhaps the most important obstacle is the impractical requirement of multiple blood samples to adequately define systemic exposure of drugs that have a short elimination half-life and are given by intermittent intravenous injections. However, the newer targeted anticancer therapies have different pharmacokinetic (PK) and dosing characteristics compared with traditional cytotoxic drugs, making it possible to estimate the steady-state drug exposure with a single trough-level measurement. Recent evidence indicates that certain PK parameters, including trough levels, are correlated with clinical outcomes for many of these agents, including imatinib, sunitinib, rituximab, and cetuximab. Although the current evidence is insufficient to mandate TDM in routine practice, a concerted investigation should be encouraged to determine whether the steady-state trough measurements of targeted agents will have a practical place in the clinical care of patients with cancer.},

Patients received topotecan intravenously on days 1-5, every 21 days, for up to six courses. In the absence of relevant haematotoxicities, topotecan was increased to 1.5 mg.m(-2) and reduced to 1.0 mg.m(-2) in case of severe haematotoxicities. Of 170 recruited patients, 73.2\% had stage IV disease and 63.4\% had platinum-containing pre-treatment. Patients received a total of 521 courses. In 72.6\% of those courses, the dose remained at 1.25 mg.m(-2); in 9.1\% it was reduced and in 18.3\% it increased. Overall response rate was 14.1\% including one complete response; 28.8\% had stable disease. Median duration of response was 13.6 weeks and median survival was 23.4 weeks. Clinical benefit was obvious for sensitive as well as for refractory patients. Haematotoxicity of grade 3 or 4 was clearly lower compared with the standard dose of 1.5 mg.m(-2). In conclusion, topotecan at a dose of 1.25 mg.m(-2) appears to be as effective as the dose of 1.5 mg.m(-2), but with reduced toxicity.

A temporal-difference learning method called Q-learning is utilized that involves learning an optimal policy from a single training set of finite longitudinal patient trajectories. Approximating the Q-function with time-indexed parameters can be achieved by using support vector regression or extremely randomized trees. Within this framework, we demonstrate that the procedure can extract optimal strategies directly from clinical data without relying on the identification of any accurate mathematical models, unlike approaches based on adaptive design. We show that reinforcement learning has tremendous potential in clinical research because it can select actions that improve outcomes by taking into account delayed effects even when the relationship between actions and outcomes is not fully known. To support our claims, the methodology's practical utility is illustrated in a simulation analysis. In the immediate future, we will apply this general strategy to studying and identifying new treatments for advanced metastatic stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer, which usually includes multiple lines of chemotherapy treatment. Moreover, there is significant potential of the proposed methodology for developing personalized treatment strategies in other cancers, in cystic fibrosis, and in other life-threatening diseases.},

We then propose an outcome weighted learning approach based on the support vector machine framework. We show that the resulting estimator of the treatment rule is consistent. We further obtain a finite sample bound for the difference between the expected outcome using the estimated individualized treatment rule and that of the optimal treatment rule.

	doi = {10.1177/1740774513480961},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditional phase I trials are designed to be conservative. Many times a traditional phase I trial design stops at a dose level below the maximal tolerated dose (MTD), thus potentially treating patients at a suboptimal level in all subsequent trials. This has been confirmed by our recent simulation studies.
PURPOSE: We propose a phase I/II trial design to determine the most promising dose level in terms of toxicity and efficacy for cytostatic or targeted agents. This design evaluates three dose levels for efficacy and toxicity using a modified phase II selection design. The dose levels include the phase I recommended dose (RD) in addition to the dose levels immediately below and above that level.
METHODS: This phase I/II trial design uses a two-step approach. In the first step, a traditional phase I trial design is used to get close to a good dose level. The second step consists of a modified selection design, randomizing patients to three dose levels: the phase I RD level and the dose levels immediately below and above the phase I RD level. Both efficacy and toxicity are used to determine a good or best dose level. Appropriate toxicity stopping rules in the phase II portion of the trial are implemented as part of such a trial. We perform simulation studies for a variety of toxicity and efficacy scenarios to determine the operating characteristics of this design and compare those to our originally proposed trial where we only explore dose levels at and below the phase I RD in the second phase of the trial, as well as to the traditional setting where a phase I trial is followed by a single-arm phase II trial at the phase I RD.
RESULTS: The 3-arm modified selection design exploring the dose levels immediately above and below as well as the RD performs as well or better than the 2-arm modified selection design or the single-arm design for almost all toxicity and efficacy scenario combinations tested.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that this design has a higher success rate at identifying a good or best dose level when exploring dose levels immediately above and below the RD in the early phase II setting, in most cases without needing larger sample sizes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Selective BCL2 inhibition with venetoclax has substantial activity in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Combination therapy with rituximab enhanced activity in preclinical models. The aim of this study was to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and activity of venetoclax in combination with rituximab.
METHODS: Adult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (according to the 2008 Modified International Workshop on CLL guidelines) or small lymphocytic lymphoma were eligible for this phase 1b, dose-escalation trial. The primary outcomes were to assess the safety profile, to determine the maximum tolerated dose, and to establish the recommended phase 2 dose of venetoclax when given in combination with rituximab. Secondary outcomes were to assess the pharmacokinetic profile and analyse efficacy, including overall response, duration of response, and time to tumour progression. Minimal residual disease was a protocol-specified exploratory objective. Central review of the endpoints was not done. Venetoclax was dosed daily using a stepwise escalation to target doses (200-600 mg) and then monthly rituximab commenced (375 mg/m(2) in month 1 and 500 mg/m(2) in months 2-6). Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for adverse events version 4.0. Protocol-guided drug cessation was allowed for patients who achieved complete response (including complete response with incomplete marrow recovery) or negative bone marrow minimal residual disease. Analyses were done per protocol for all patients who commenced drug and included all patients who received at least one dose of venetoclax. Data were pooled across dose cohorts. Patients are still receiving therapy and follow-up is ongoing. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01682616.
FINDINGS: Between Aug 6, 2012, and May 28, 2014, we enrolled 49 patients. Common grade 1-2 toxicities included upper respiratory tract infections (in 28 [57\%] of 49 patients), diarrhoea (27 [55\%]), and nausea (25 [51\%]). Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 37 (76\%) of 49 patients; most common were neutropenia (26 [53\%]), thrombocytopenia (eight [16\%]), anaemia (seven [14\%]), febrile neutropenia (six [12\%]), and leucopenia (six [12\%]). The most common serious adverse events were pyrexia (six [12\%]), febrile neutropenia (five [10\%]), lower respiratory tract infection, and pneumonia (each three [6\%]). Clinical tumour lysis syndrome occurred in two patients (resulting in one death) who initiated venetoclax at 50 mg. After enhancing tumour lysis syndrome prophylaxis measures and commencing venetoclax at 20 mg, clinical tumour lysis syndrome did not occur. The maximum tolerated dose was not identified; the recommended phase 2 dose of venetoclax in combination with rituximab was 400 mg. Overall, 42 (86\%) of 49 patients achieved a response, including a complete response in 25 (51\%) of 49 patients. 2 year estimates for progression-free survival and ongoing response were 82\% (95\% CI 66-91) and 89\% (95\% CI 72-96), respectively. Negative marrow minimal residual disease was attained in 20 (80\%) of 25 complete responders and 28 (57\%) of 49 patients overall. 13 responders ceased all therapy; among these all 11 minimal residual disease-negative responders remain progression-free off therapy. Two with minimal residual disease-positive complete response progressed after 24 months off therapy and re-attained response after re-initiation of venetoclax.
INTERPRETATION: A substantial proportion of patients achieved an overall response with the combination of venetoclax and rituximab including 25 (51\%) of 49 patients who achieved a complete response and 28 (57\%) of 49 patients who achieved negative marrow minimal residual disease with acceptable safety. The depth and durability of responses observed with the combination offers an attractive potential treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and could allow some patients to maintain response after discontinuing therapy, a strategy that warrants further investigation in randomised studies.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ibrutinib, idelalisib, and venetoclax are approved for treating CLL patients in the US. However, there is no guidance as to their optimal sequence.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis of CLL patients treated with kinase inhibitors (KIs) or venetoclax. We examined demographics, discontinuation reasons, overall response rates (ORR), survival, and post-KI salvage strategies. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: A total of 683 patients were identified. Baseline characteristics were similar in the ibrutinib and idelalisib groups. ORR to ibrutinib and idelalisib as first KI was 69\% and 81\% respectively. With a median follow up of 17 months (range 1-60), median PFS and OS for the entire cohort were 35 months and not reached. Patients treated with ibrutinib (vs. idelalisib) as first KI had a significantly better PFS in all settings; front-line (HR 2.8, CI1.3-6.3 p=.01), relapsed-refractory (HR 2.8, CI 1.9-4.1 p{\textless}.001), del17p (HR 2.0, CI 1.2-3.4 p=.008), and complex karyotype (HR 2.5, CI 1.2-5.2 p=.02). At the time of initial KI failure, use of an alternate KI or venetoclax had a superior PFS as compared to chemoimmunotherapy (CIT). Furthermore, patients who discontinued ibrutinib due to progression or toxicity had marginally improved outcomes if they received venetoclax (ORR 79\%) versus idelalisib (ORR 46\%) (PFS HR .6, CI.3-1.0, p=.06).
CONCLUSIONS: In the largest real-world experience of novel agents in CLL, ibrutinib appears superior to idelalisib as first KI. Further, in the setting of KI failure, alternate KI or venetoclax therapy appear superior to CIT combinations. The use of venetoclax upon ibrutinib failure might be superior to idelalisib. These data support the need for trials testing sequencing strategies to optimize treatment algorithms.},

The aim of this analysis was to characterize venetoclax pharmacokinetics in the plasma and urine of patients with hematological malignancies and evaluate the effect of dose proportionality, accumulation, weak and moderate CYP3A inhibitors, as well as low- and high-fat meals on venetoclax pharmacokinetics. Patients received a once-daily venetoclax dose of 20 to 1200 mg. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using noncompartmental methods. Venetoclax peak exposures were achieved at 5 to 8 hours under low-fat conditions, and the mean terminal-phase elimination half-life ranged between 14.1 and 18.2 hours at different doses. Venetoclax steady-state exposures showed minimal accumulation and increased proportionally over the dose range of 300 to 900 mg. Low-fat and high-fat meals increased venetoclax exposures by approximately 4-fold relative to the fasting state. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors increased venetoclax exposures by 40\% to 60\%, whereas weak CYP3A inhibitors had no effect. A negligible amount of venetoclax was excreted in the urine. In summary, venetoclax exhibits a pharmacokinetic profile that is compatible with once-daily dosing with food regardless of fat content. Concomitant use of venetoclax with moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided or venetoclax dose should be reduced during the venetoclax initiation and ramp-up phase in CLL patients. Renal excretion plays a minimal role in the elimination of venetoclax.},

A minimal PBPK model was developed based on prior in vitro and in vivo clinical data using a "middle-out" approach. The PBPK model was independently verified against clinical studies of the strong CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole, the strong CYP3A inducer, multiple-dose rifampin, and the steady-state venetoclax PK in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) subjects by comparing predicted to observed ratios of the venetoclax maximum concentration (Cmax R) and area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC∞ R) from these studies. The verified PBPK model was then used to simulate the effects of different CYP3A inhibitors and inducers on the venetoclax PK. Comparison of the PBPK model predicted to the observed PK parameters indicated good agreement. Verification of the PBPK model demonstrated that the ratios of the predicted:observed Cmax R and AUC∞ R of venetoclax were within 0.8- to 1.25-fold range for strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers. Model simulations indicated no effect of weak CYP3A inhibitors or inducers on Cmax or AUC∞ , while both moderate and strong CYP3A inducers were estimated to decrease venetoclax exposure. Moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors were estimated to increase venetoclax AUC∞ , by 100\% to 390\% and 480\% to 680\%, respectively. The recommended venetoclax dose reductions of at least 50\% and 75\% when coadministered with moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors, respectively, maintain venetoclax exposures between therapeutic and maximally administered safe doses.},

The objective of this research was to characterize the relationship between venetoclax exposures and progression-free survival (PFS) and to evaluate the effect of rituximab coadministration on PFS in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). A total of 323 patients from 3 clinical studies of venetoclax, with and without rituximab coadministration, were pooled for the analyses. A time-variant relative risk survival model was used to relate plasma venetoclax concentrations and rituximab administration to PFS. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were evaluated for their effect on PFS. A concentration-dependent effect of venetoclax on PFS and a prolonged synergistic effect of 6 cycles of concomitant rituximab were identified. The 17p deletion chromosomal aberration was not identified to affect the PFS of patients treated with venetoclax. A venetoclax dose of 400 mg daily QD was estimated to result in a substantial median PFS of 1.8 years (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-2.1), whereas the addition of 6 cycles of rituximab was estimated to increase the median PFS to 3.9 years (95\% CI, 2.8-5.6). The analysis demonstrates a concentration-dependent effect of venetoclax on PFS and also a synergistic effect with rituximab. Combining venetoclax with the CD20 targeting monoclonal antibody rituximab in R/R CLL/SLL patients provides substantial synergistic benefit compared with increasing the venetoclax monotherapy dose.},

The objective of this analysis was to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of venetoclax and identify demographic, pathophysiologic, and treatment factors that influence its pharmacokinetics. Plasma concentration samples from 505 subjects enrolled in 8 clinical studies were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. Venetoclax plasma concentrations were best described by a two-compartment PK model with first-order absorption and elimination. The terminal half-life in cancer subjects was estimated to be approximately 26 h. Moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors decreased venetoclax apparent clearance by 19\% and 84\%, respectively, while weak CYP3A inhibitors and inducers did not affect clearance. Additionally, concomitant rituximab administration was estimated to increase venetoclax apparent clearance by 21\%. Gastric acid-reducing agent co-administration had no impact on the rate or extent of venetoclax absorption. Females had 32\% lower central volume of distribution when compared to males. Food increased the bioavailability by 2.99- to 4.25-fold when compared to the fasting state. Mild and moderate renal and hepatic impairment, body weight, age, race, weak CYP3A inhibitors and inducers as well as OATP1B1 transporter phenotype and P-gp, BCRP, and OATP1B1/OATP1B3 modulators had no impact on venetoclax pharmacokinetics. Venetoclax showed minimal accumulation with accumulation ratio of 1.30-1.44. In conclusion, the concomitant administration of moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors and rituximab as well as food were the main factors impacting venetoclax pharmacokinetics, while patient characteristics had only minimal impact.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The effect of posaconazole, a strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitor and commonly used antifungal agent, on the pharmacokinetic properties of venetoclax, a CYP3A substrate, was evaluated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia to determine the dose adjustments needed to manage this potential interaction.
METHODS: Twelve patients received 20- to 200-mg ramp-up treatment with oral venetoclax and 20 mg/m(2) of intravenous decitabine on days 1 through 5, followed by 400 mg of venetoclax alone on days 6 through 20. On days 21 through 28, patients received 300 mg of posaconazole plus reduced doses of venetoclax (50 or 100 mg) to account for expected increases in venetoclax plasma concentrations. Blood samples were collected before dosing and up to 24 hours after the venetoclax dose on days 20 and 28.
FINDINGS: Compared with a venetoclax dose of 400 mg when administered alone (day 20), coadministration of venetoclax at a 50-mg dose with multiple doses of posaconazole increased mean venetoclax Cmax and AUC0-24 by 53\% and 76\%, respectively, whereas coadministration of venetoclax at a 100-mg dose with posaconazole increased mean venetoclax Cmax and AUC0-24 by 93\% and 155\%, respectively. When adjusted for different doses and nonlinearity, posaconazole was estimated to increase venetoclax Cmax and AUC0-24 by 7.1- and 8.8-fold, respectively. Both the 50- and 100-mg venetoclax doses administered with posaconazole were well tolerated.
IMPLICATIONS: The results are consistent with inhibition of CYP3A-mediated metabolism of venetoclax. Posaconazole can be used for antifungal prophylaxis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving venetoclax after reducing the venetoclax dose by at least 75\%.

In addition, as outcome-adaptive dose finding methods often involve complex algorithms, it is crucial to have diagnostic tools to evaluate the plausibility of a method's simulated performance and the adequacy of the algorithm. In this article, we propose a simple technique that provides an upper limit, or a benchmark, of accuracy for dose finding methods for a given design objective. The proposed benchmark is nonparametric optimal in the sense of O'Quigley et al. (2002, Biostatistics 3, 51-56), and is demonstrated by examples to be a practical accuracy upper bound for model-based dose finding methods. We illustrate the implementation of the technique in the context of phase I trials that consider multiple toxicities and phase I/II trials where dosing decisions are based on both toxicity and efficacy, and apply the benchmark to several clinical examples considered in the literature. By comparing the operating characteristics of a dose finding method to that of the benchmark, we can form quick initial assessments of whether the method is adequately calibrated and evaluate its sensitivity to the dose-outcome relationships.},

	abstract = {A rapidly increasing number of Phase I dose-finding studies, and in particular those based on the standard 3+3 design, are being prolonged with the inclusion of dose expansion cohorts (DEC) in order to better characterize the toxicity profiles of experimental agents and to study disease-specific cohorts. These trials consist of two phases: the usual dose escalation phase that aims to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the dose expansion phase that accrues additional patients, often with different eligibility criteria, and where additional information is collected. Current protocols do not always specify whether and how the MTD will be updated in light of the new data accumulated from the DEC. In this paper, we propose methods that allow monitoring of safety in the DEC by re-evaluating the MTD in light of additional information. Our working assumption is that, regardless of the design being used for dose escalation, during the DEC we are experimenting in the neighborhood of a target dose with an acceptable rate of toxicity. We refine our initial estimate of the MTD by continuing experimentation in the immediate vicinity of the initial estimate of the MTD. The auxiliary information provided in such an evaluation can include toxicity, pharmacokinetic, efficacy or other endpoints. We consider approaches specifically focused on the aims of DEC that examine efficacy alone or simultaneously with safety and compare the proposed tests via simulations.},

Despite established guidelines supporting outpatient management of low-risk neutropenic fever (LRNF), provider awareness is low, and inpatient admission for intravenous antibiotics continues to be standard of care.Methods:Inpatient provider algorithm implementation and education began in the second quarter of 2014. Providers calculated MASCC scores for patients with nonleukemia hematologic malignancies and solid tumors at admission. Data were collected in a prospectively maintained registry. Patients identified as low risk by MASCC score were placed under observation and started on oral antibiotics. If exclusion criteria and social barriers were not identified, discharge within 48 hours was planned.Results:Eighty-three patients with NF were admitted to the Taussig Cancer Institute inpatient oncology unit between November 2014 and June 2015. Fifty-three patients (64\%) had LRNF by MASCC score. Patients with LRNF had an average length of stay of 3.3 days, compared with 6.2 days in our historical cohort. Sixteen patients (30\%) were discharged within 24 hours. Only two patients with LRNF had a culture-proven infection, both Enterococcus urinary tract infections. Three patients required nonelective readmission. There were no deaths caused by NF.Conclusion:This pilot study demonstrates that a formal algorithm for LRNF management combined with provider education can improve current inpatient standard of care and length of stay without an increase in morbidity.},

	abstract = {PurposeThis multicenter study, to our knowledge, is the first phase III trial to compare trabectedin versus dacarbazine in patients with advanced liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma after prior therapy with an anthracycline and at least one additional systemic regimen.Patients and MethodsPatients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive trabectedin or dacarbazine intravenously every 3 weeks. The primary end point was overall survival (OS), secondary end points were disease control—progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression, objective response rate, and duration of response—as well as safety and patient-reported symptom scoring.ResultsA total of 518 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either trabectedin (n = 345) or dacarbazine (n = 173). In the final analysis of PFS, trabectedin administration resulted in a 45\% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared with dacarbazine (median PFS for trabectedin v dacarbazine, 4.2 v 1.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.55; P {\textless} .001); benefits were observed across all preplanned subgroup analyses. The interim analysis of OS (64\% censored) demonstrated a 13\% reduction in risk of death in the trabectedin arm compared with dacarbazine (median OS for trabectedin v dacarbazine, 12.4 v 12.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.87; P = .37). The safety profiles were consistent with the well-characterized toxicities of both agents, and the most common grade 3 to 4 adverse effects were myelosuppression and transient elevation of transaminases in the trabectedin arm.ConclusionTrabectedin demonstrates superior disease control versus conventional dacarbazine in patients who have advanced liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma after they experience failure of prior chemotherapy. Because disease control in advanced sarcomas is a clinically relevant end point, this study supports the activity of trabectedin for patients with these malignancies.},

	doi = {10.7490/f1000research.1113595.1},
	abstract = {PROBLEM

The calcineurin inhibitors are the most widely used class of immunosuppressant after solid organ transplant, yet they are pharmacologically troublesome agents. Their narrow therapeutic windows necessitate therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), which is markedly complicated by the pharmacokinetic variability of these agents across populations and even within individuals over time.

HYPOTHESES
A rigorous, model-based dose titration algorithm will outperform standard informal dose titration done without support from a formal decision aid.
The intra-individual pharmacokinetic variability of the calcineurin inhibitors strongly indicates application of adaptive algorithms such as the Kalman Filter (KF).
A Kalman Filter-based dose titration algorithm will prove robust to model misspecification.
The technique is conceptually intuitive enough to be readily accepted by practitioners.


METHODS
IRB approval was obtained for retrospective review of inpatient medical records for kidney transplants at Rhode Island Hospital in the years 2005-2010.
We retrospectively studied tacrolimus dose titration courses of 32 kidney transplant recipients, selected for uniformity in the protocols applied to immunosuppression and dose titration. Each subject had received basiliximab induction, tacrolimus, mycophenylate mofetil and prednisone; each subject's tacrolimus dose had been titrated by a clinical protocol targeting trough blood levels of 8-12 ng/mL by post-operative day 4.
For each subject separately, an extended Kalman filter was applied to estimate a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model against the time series of that subject’s recorded doses and measured drug levels. This yielded for each subject a running estimate of the twice-daily dose needed to achieve a target trough concentration C12 of 10 ng/mL.
A counterfactual exercise was undertaken, in which these running estimates – regarded as KF-suggested dosing – were contrasted graphically with the actual dosing, in light of actual drug concentrations achieved.


RESULTS

In half (16/32) of our cohort, actual and KF-suggested dosing largely coincided. In the remainder, KF dosing appeared superior for 10 subjects, and inferior for 6.

DISCUSSION

TDM in our cohort was done every 24 hours, on roughly a C9 basis; 70\% of draws were done 9±1.5 hours after the previous dose. This regular TDM timing offered us insufficient degrees of freedom to simultaneously estimate both compartmental volume V1/F and elimination half-life τ1/2 in our pharmacokinetic model. We therefore fixed V1/F at 3L per kg body mass, leaving τ1/2 as the sole free parameter of the model. As hypothesized, the Kalman filter performed well, despite what was surely a grossly misspecified model. We credit this to the adaptive nature of the filter.

A key insight from this effort is that scheduling TDM at whole-number multiples of the dosing cycle poorly supports model-based dosing. Prospective studies of adaptive filters may benefit from TDM scheduled every 18 hours, to sample (alternately) two points on the elimination curve – say C6 and C12. Of course, in a sufficiently sophisticated approach to this problem, TDM scheduling will itself be adaptive and model-driven. 

CONCLUSION

The Kalman filter appears capable of performing at least on par with experienced clinicians in tacrolimus titration. Good reason exists to evaluate our approach prospectively, under a TDM regime favorable to simultaneous estimation of both free parameters of our pharmacokinetic model.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a semimechanistic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model describing chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression through drug-specific parameters and system-related parameters, which are common to all drugs.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient leukocyte and neutrophil data after administration of docetaxel, paclitaxel, and etoposide were used to develop the model, which was also applied to myelosuppression data from 2'-deoxy-2'-methylidenecytidine (DMDC), irinotecan (CPT-11), and vinflunine administrations. The model consisted of a proliferating compartment that was sensitive to drugs, three transit compartments that represented maturation, and a compartment of circulating blood cells. Three system-related parameters were estimated: baseline, mean transit time, and a feedback parameter. Drug concentration-time profiles affected the proliferation of sensitive cells by either an inhibitory linear model or an inhibitory E(max) model. To evaluate the model, system-related parameters were fixed to the same values for all drugs, which were based on the results from the estimations, and only drug-specific parameters were estimated. All modeling was performed using NONMEM software.
RESULTS: For all investigated drugs, the model successfully described myelosuppression. Consecutive courses and different schedules of administration were also well characterized. Similar system-related parameter estimates were obtained for the different drugs and also for leukocytes compared with neutrophils. In addition, when system-related parameters were fixed, the model well characterized chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression for the different drugs.
CONCLUSION: This model predicted myelosuppression after administration of one of several different chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, with fixed system-related parameters to proposed values, and only drug-related parameters estimated, myelosuppression can be predicted. We propose that this model can be a useful tool in the development of anticancer drugs and therapies.},

The imposed constraint incorporates the optimal design points and their weights and ensures that the probability that an administered dose exceeds the maximum acceptable dose is low. Results relating to these constrained designs for log doses on the real line are described and the associated equivalence theorem is given. The ideas are extended to more practical situations, specifically to those involving discrete doses.

Blinatumomab was administered over 4 or 8 weeks at seven different dose levels (0.5 to 90 μg/m2/day). End points were incidence of adverse events, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and overall response rate.ResultsBetween 2004 and 2011, 76 heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory NHL, who included 14 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, were enrolled; 42 received treatment in the formal dose-escalation phase. Neurologic events were dose limiting, and 60 μg/m2/day was established as the MTD. Thirty-four additional patients were recruited to evaluate antilymphoma activity and strategies for mitigating neurologic events at a prespecified MTD. Stepwise dosing (5 to 60 μg/m2/day) plus pentosan polysulfate SP54 (n = 3) resulted in no treatment discontinuations; single-step (n = 5) and double-step (n = 24) dosing entailed two and seven treatment discontinuations due to neurologic events, respectively. Grade 3 neurologic events occurred in 22\% of patients (no grade 4/5). Among patients treated at 60 μg/m2/day (target dose; n = 35), the overall response rate was 69\% across NHL subtypes and 55\% for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 11); median response duration was 404 days (95\% CI, 207 to 1,129 days).ConclusionIn this phase I study of relapsed/refractory NHL, continuous infusion with CD19-targeted immunotherapy blinatumomab at various doses and schedules was feasible, with an MTD of 60 μg/m2/day.

Some patients treated with blinatumomab and other T cell-activating therapies develop cytokine release syndrome (CRS). We hypothesized that patients with more severe toxicity may experience abnormal macrophage activation triggered by the release of cytokines by T-cell receptor-activated cytotoxic T cells engaged by BiTE antibodies and leading to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). We prospectively monitored a patient during blinatumomab treatment and observed that he developed HLH.

He developed hyperferritinemia, cytopenias, hypofibrinogenemia, and a cytokine profile diagnostic for HLH. The HLH continued to progress after discontinuation of blinatumomab; however, he had rapid improvement after IL-6 receptor-directed therapy with tocilizumab. Patients treated with T cell-activating therapies, including blinatumomab, should be monitored for HLH, and cytokine-directed therapy may be considered in cases of life-threatening CRS.

The study is suspended to accrual with every 3rd patient, and again suspended to replace inevaluable patients. As the pediatric phase I starting dose is based on adult phase I safety data, we hypothesized that pediatric study timelines could be shortened without increasing risk using a novel rolling six design, in which up to 6 patients are concurrently enrolled per dose level. Methods: A trial simulation approach comparing the standard 3+3 design to the rolling six design was performed. Discrete time events (accrual/enrollment, evaluation and/or time to dose limiting toxicity (DLT) or inevaluability) with outcome probabilities (DLT/inevaluability) assigned to each subject based on historical data from phase I pediatric oncology trials. The probability of DLT was a function of dose level and varied distributions were used to assign discrete time elements. Metrics for study efficiency (time to complete study, total number of patients required) were determined for each design. Simulated trials and decision rule logic were coded using PC/Windows SAS v9.1. Results: The rolling six design outperformed the 3+3 design for the most relevant metrics. Average (±SD) time to study completion was 373±90 days vs. 431±98 days and the total number of patients required was 20±5 vs. 17±4 for the rolling six vs. 3+3 designs, respectively. There was no difference in the number of DLTs per study (3±1) between designs. Conclusions: The rolling six design is predicted to shorten pediatric phase 1 study timelines and will be tested prospectively in upcoming COG phase I trials.

	abstract = {Purpose To shorten the study conduct timeline of pediatric phase I oncology trials by employing a novel trial design.   Methods A comparison of the traditional 3 + 3 patients per cohort, phase I trial design with a novel, rolling six design was performed by using discrete event simulation. The rolling six design allows for accrual of two to six patients concurrently onto a dose level based on the number of patients currently enrolled and evaluable, the number experiencing dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and the number still at risk of developing a DLT. Clinical trial simulations (n = 1,000) were based on historical data and were performed using SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Study timelines and patient numbers were determined for each design, and safety was assessed as a function of the number of DLTs observed.   Results In twelve completed historical studies, the median time to study completion was 452 days (range, 220 to 606 days); number of evaluable participants enrolled was 22 (range, 11 to 33), and DLTs occurring per study was three (range, 0 to 5). In 1,000 study simulations, in which the average time to new patient accrual was 10 days, the average ± standard deviation (SD) time to study completion was 294 ± 75 days for the rolling six design versus 350 ± 84 days for the 3 + 3 design, whereas the number of DLTs per study was the same (average ± SD, 3.3 ± 1.1 v 3.2 ± 1.1 for the rolling six and 3 + 3 designs, respectively).   Conclusion The rolling six design may significantly decrease the duration of pediatric phase I studies without increasing the risk of toxicity. The design will be tested prospectively in upcoming Children's Oncology Group phase I trials.},

	abstract = {The toxicities of immunotherapy for cancer are as diverse as the type of treatments that have been devised. These range from cytokine therapies that induce capillary leakage to vaccines associated with low levels of autoimmunity to cell therapies that can induce damaging cross-reactivity with normal tissue to checkpoint protein inhibitors that induce immune-related adverse events that are autoinflammatory in nature. The thread that ties these toxicities together is their mechanism-based immune nature and the T-cell–mediated adverse events seen. The basis for the majority of these adverse events is a hyperactivated T-cell response with reactivity directed against normal tissue, resulting in the generation of high levels of CD4 T-helper cell cytokines or increased migration of cytolytic CD8 T cells within normal tissues. The T-cell immune response is not tissue specific and may reflect a diffuse expansion of the T-cell repertoire that induces cross-reactivity with normal tissue, effectively breaking tolerance that is active with cytokines, vaccines, and checkpoint protein inhibitors and passive in the case of adoptive cell therapy. Cytokines seem to generate diffuse and nonspecific T-cell reactivity, whereas checkpoint protein inhibition, vaccines, and adoptive cell therapy seem to activate more specific T cells that interact directly with normal tissues, potentially causing specific organ damage. In this review, we summarize the toxicities that are unique to immunotherapies, emphasizing the need to familiarize the oncology practitioner with the spectrum of adverse events seen with newly approved and emerging modalities.},

	abstract = {PurposeBlinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager antibody construct targeting CD19 on B-cell lymphoblasts. We evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, recommended dosage, and potential for efficacy of blinatumomab in children with relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL).MethodsThis open-label study enrolled children {\textless} 18 years old with relapsed/refractory BCP-ALL in a phase I dosage-escalation part and a phase II part, using 6-week treatment cycles. Primary end points were maximum-tolerated dosage (phase I) and complete remission rate within the first two cycles (phase II).ResultsWe treated 49 patients in phase I and 44 patients in phase II. Four patients had dose-limiting toxicities in cycle 1 (phase I). Three experienced grade 4 cytokine-release syndrome (one attributed to grade 5 cardiac failure); one had fatal respiratory failure. The maximum-tolerated dosage was 15 µg/m2/d. Blinatumomab pharmacokinetics was linear across dosage levels and consistent among age groups. On the basis of the phase I data, the recommended blinatumomab dosage for children with relapsed/refractory ALL was 5 µg/m2/d for the first 7 days, followed by 15 µg/m2/d thereafter. Among the 70 patients who received the recommended dosage, 27 (39\%; 95\% CI, 27\% to 51\%) achieved complete remission within the first two cycles, 14 (52\%) of whom achieved complete minimal residual disease response. The most frequent grade ≥ 3 adverse events were anemia (36\%), thrombocytopenia (21\%), and hypokalemia (17\%). Three patients (4\%) and one patient (1\%) had cytokine-release syndrome of grade 3 and 4, respectively. Two patients (3\%) interrupted treatment after grade 2 seizures.ConclusionThis trial, which to the best of our knowledge was the first such trial in pediatrics, demonstrated antileukemic activity of single-agent blinatumomab with complete minimal residual disease response in children with relapsed/refractory BCP-ALL. Blinatumomab may represent an important new treatment option in this setting, requiring further investigation in curative indications.},

This remarkable characteristic indicates that these models may be useful in the development of personalized medicine, which aims at finding treatment regimes that are appropriate for particular patients, not just appropriate for the average patient. In fact, published developments show that random-effects linear models may provide a solid theoretical framework for drug dosage individualization in chronic diseases. In particular, individualized dosages computed with these models by means of an empirical Bayesian approach may produce better results than dosages computed with some methods routinely used in therapeutic drug monitoring. This is further supported by published empirical and theoretical findings that show that random effects linear models may provide accurate representations of phase III and IV steady-state pharmacokinetic data, and may be useful for dosage computations. These models have applications in the design of clinical algorithms for drug dosage individualization in chronic diseases; in the computation of dose correction factors; computation of the minimum number of blood samples from a patient that are necessary for calculating an optimal individualized drug dosage in therapeutic drug monitoring; measure of the clinical importance of clinical, demographic, environmental or genetic covariates; study of drug-drug interactions in clinical settings; the implementation of computational tools for web-site-based evidence farming; design of pharmacogenomic studies; and in the development of a pharmacological theory of dosage individualization.},

	abstract = {Background: Absent adaptive, individualized dose-finding in early-phase oncology trials, subsequent registration trials risk suboptimal dosing that compromises statistical power and lowers the probability of technical success (PTS) for the investigational drug. While much methodological progress has been made toward adaptive dose-finding, and quantitative modeling of dose-response relationships, most such work continues to be organized around a concept of ‘the’ maximum tolerated dose (MTD). But a new methodology, Dose Titration Algorithm Tuning (DTAT), now holds forth the promise of individualized ‘MTDi’ dosing. Relative to such individualized dosing, current ‘one-size-fits-all’ dosing practices amount to a constraint that imposes costs on society. This paper estimates the magnitude of these costs. Methods: Simulated dose titration as in (Norris F1000Research 2017;6:112) is extended to 1000 subjects, yielding an empirical MTDi distribution to which a gamma density is fitted. Individual-level efficacy, in terms of the probability of achieving remission, is assumed to be an Emax-type function of dose relative to MTDi, scaled (arbitrarily) to identify MTDi with the LD50 of the individual's tumor. (Thus, a criterion 50\% of the population achieve remission under individualized dosing in this analysis.) Current practice is modeled such that all patients receive a first-cycle dose at ‘the’ MTD, and those for whom MTDi {\textless} MTDthe experience a ‘dose-limiting toxicity’ (DLT) that aborts subsequent cycles. Therapy thus terminated is assumed to confer no benefit. Individuals for whom MTDi ≥ MTDthe tolerate a full treatment course, and achieve remission with probability determined by the Emax curve evaluated at MTDthe/MTDi. A closed-form expression is obtained for the population remission rate, and maximized numerically over MTDthe as a free parameter, thus identifying the best result achievable under one-size-fits-all dosing. A sensitivity analysis is performed, using both a perturbation of the assumed Emax function, and an antipodal alternative specification. Results: Simulated MTDi follow a gamma distribution with shape parameter α ≈ 1.75. The population remission rate under one-size-fits-all dosing at the maximizing value of MTDthe proves to be a function of the shape parameter — and thus the coefficient of variation (CV) — of the gamma distribution of MTDi. Within a plausible range of CV(MTDi), one-size-fits-all dosing wastes approximately half of the drug's population-level efficacy. In the sensitivity analysis, sensitivity to the perturbation proves to be of second order. The alternative exposure-efficacy specification likewise leaves all results intact. Conclusions: The CV of MTDi determines the efficacy lost under one-size-fits-all dosing at ‘the’ MTD. Within plausible ranges for this CV, failure to individualize dosing can effectively halve a drug's value to society. In a competitive environment dominated by regulatory hurdles, this may reduce the value of shareholders' investment in the drug to zero.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The objective was to determine the safety and clinical activity of atezolizumab (MPDL3280A), a humanized programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody, in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Exploratory biomarkers were analyzed and associated with outcomes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy patients with metastatic RCC, including clear cell (ccRCC; n = 63) and non-clear cell (ncc; n = 7) histologies, received atezolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks. PD-L1 expression was scored at four diagnostic levels (0/1/2/3) that were based on PD-L1 staining on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC) with the SP142 assay. Primary end points were safety and toxicity; secondary end points assessed clinical activity per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 and immune-related response criteria. Plasma and tissue were analyzed for potential biomarkers of atezolizumab response.
RESULTS: Grade 3 treatment-related and immune-mediated adverse events occurred in 17\% and 4\% of patients, respectively, and there were no grade 4 or 5 events. Sixty-three patients with ccRCC were evaluable for overall survival (median, 28.9 months; 95\% CI, 20.0 months to not reached) and progression-free survival (median, 5.6 months; 95\% CI, 3.9 to 8.2 months), and 62 patients were evaluable for objective response rate (ORR; 15\%; 95\% CI, 7\% to 26\%). ORR was evaluated on the basis of PD-L1 IC expression (IC1/2/3: n = 33; 18\%; 95\% CI, 7\% to 35\%; and IC0: n = 22; 9\%; 95\% CI, 1\% to 29\%). The ORR for patients with Fuhrman grade 4 and/or sarcomatoid histology was 22\% (n = 18; 95\% CI, 6\% to 48\%). Decreases in circulating plasma markers and acute-phase proteins and an increased baseline effector T-cell-to-regulatory T-cell gene expression ratio correlated with response to atezolizumab.
CONCLUSION: Atezolizumab demonstrated a manageable safety profile and promising antitumor activity in patients with metastatic RCC. Correlative studies identified potential predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. These results have guided ongoing studies and combinations with atezolizumab in RCC.},

	abstract = {4505Background: While inhibiting VEGF improves outcomes in mRCC pts, most develop resistance, often within a year. Here, we report results from a Ph II study of atezo (anti–PD-L1) and bev (anti-VEGF) vs and following atezo or sun (TKI) in mRCC pts. Methods: Pts with untreated mRCC were enrolled in the hypothesis generating IMmotion150 study (NCT01984242) and randomized to atezo 1200 mg IV q3w + bev 15 mg/kg IV q3w, atezo alone or sun 50 mg PO QD 4 wk on/2 wk off. After progression on atezo or sun, crossover to atezo + bev was allowed. PD-L1 status was scored on tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC, SP142 IHC assay). The primary analysis was modified prior to final analysis to reflect the coprimary endpoints of IRF-assessed PFS (RECIST v1.1) in ITT pts and pts with PD-L1 expression on ≥ 1\% of IC (PD-L1+). Results: 54\% of pts were PD-L1+. In PD-L1+ pts 1L treatment resulted in a PFS hazard ratio (HR) of 0.64 for atezo + bev vs sun (table). After 1L treatment, 78\% of sun and 60\% of atezo pts who progressed subsequently received atezo + bev and achieved ORRs of 28\% and 24\%, respectively (table). Safety was comparable to the known individual profiles of atezo and bev. Additional clinical, safety and biomarker data will be presented. Conclusions: Atezo + bev resulted in encouraging antitumor activity in 1L pts with PD-L1+ mRCC. Preliminary activity in the 2L setting was demonstrated in pts who crossed over to atezo + bev, regardless of prior therapy. 1L atezo + bev vs sun is being evaluated in the ongoing Ph III study IMmotion151 (NCT02420821).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with melanoma, ipilimumab (an antibody against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 [CTLA-4]) prolongs overall survival, and nivolumab (an antibody against the programmed death 1 [PD-1] receptor) produced durable tumor regression in a phase 1 trial. On the basis of their distinct immunologic mechanisms of action and supportive preclinical data, we conducted a phase 1 trial of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma.
METHODS: We administered intravenous doses of nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab alone every 3 weeks for 4 doses (concurrent regimen). The combined treatment was subsequently administered every 12 weeks for up to 8 doses. In a sequenced regimen, patients previously treated with ipilimumab received nivolumab every 2 weeks for up to 48 doses.
RESULTS: A total of 53 patients received concurrent therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab, and 33 received sequenced treatment. The objective-response rate (according to modified World Health Organization criteria) for all patients in the concurrent-regimen group was 40\%. Evidence of clinical activity (conventional, unconfirmed, or immune-related response or stable disease for ≥24 weeks) was observed in 65\% of patients. At the maximum doses that were associated with an acceptable level of adverse events (nivolumab at a dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight and ipilimumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram), 53\% of patients had an objective response, all with tumor reduction of 80\% or more. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events related to therapy occurred in 53\% of patients in the concurrent-regimen group but were qualitatively similar to previous experience with monotherapy and were generally reversible. Among patients in the sequenced-regimen group, 18\% had grade 3 or 4 adverse events related to therapy and the objective-response rate was 20\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab had a manageable safety profile and provided clinical activity that appears to be distinct from that in published data on monotherapy, with rapid and deep tumor regression in a substantial proportion of patients.

	abstract = {Background The advent of targeted therapy for cancer treatment has brought about a paradigm shift in the clinical management of human malignancies. Agents such as erlotinib used for EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer or imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia, for instance, lead to rapid tumor responses. Unfortunately, however, resistance often emerges and renders these agents ineffective after a variable amount of time. The FDA-approved dosing schedules for these drugs were not designed to optimally prevent the emergence of resistance. To this end, we have previously utilized evolutionary mathematical modeling of treatment responses to elucidate the dosing schedules best able to prevent or delay the onset of resistance. Here we expand on our approaches by taking into account dose-dependent mutation rates at which resistant cells emerge. The relationship between the serum drug concentration and the rate at which resistance mutations arise can lead to non-intuitive results about the best dose administration strategies to prevent or delay the emergence of resistance.   Methods We used mathematical modeling, available clinical trial data, and different considerations of the relationship between mutation rate and drug concentration to predict the effectiveness of different dosing strategies.   Results We designed several distinct measures to interrogate the effects of different treatment dosing strategies and found that a low-dose continuous strategy coupled with high-dose pulses leads to the maximal delay until clinically observable resistance. Furthermore, the response to treatment is robust against different assumptions of the mutation rate as a function of drug concentration.   Conclusions For new and existing targeted drugs, our methodology can be employed to compare the effectiveness of different dose administration schedules and investigate the influence of changing mutation rates on outcomes.},

The MTD/3 + 3 approach is not optimal and may result in recommended doses that are unacceptably toxic for many patients and in dose reduction/interruptions that might have an impact on effectiveness. Instead of the MTD/3 + 3 approach, the authors recommend an integrated approach. In this approach, typically an adaptive/Bayesian model provides a general framework to incorporate and make decisions for dose escalation based on nonclinical data, such as animal efficacy and toxicity data; clinical data, including pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics data; and dose/exposure-response data for efficacy and safety. To improve dose-ranging trials, model-based estimation, rather than hypothesis testing, should be used to maximize and integrate the information gathered across trials and doses. This approach may improve identification of optimal recommended doses, which can then be confirmed in registration trials.

	abstract = {The programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor serves as an immunologic checkpoint, limiting bystander tissue damage and preventing the development of autoimmunity during inflammatory responses. PD-1 is expressed by activated T cells and downmodulates T-cell effector functions upon binding to its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, on antigen-presenting cells. In patients with cancer, the expression of PD-1 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and its interaction with the ligands on tumor and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment undermine antitumor immunity and support its rationale for PD-1 blockade in cancer immunotherapy. This report details the development and characterization of nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 (S228P) anti-PD-1 receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody. Nivolumab binds to PD-1 with high affinity and specificity, and effectively inhibits the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands. In vitro assays demonstrated the ability of nivolumab to potently enhance T-cell responses and cytokine production in the mixed lymphocyte reaction and superantigen or cytomegalovirus stimulation assays. No in vitro antibody-dependent cell-mediated or complement-dependent cytotoxicity was observed with the use of nivolumab and activated T cells as targets. Nivolumab treatment did not induce adverse immune-related events when given to cynomolgus macaques at high concentrations, independent of circulating anti-nivolumab antibodies where observed. These data provide a comprehensive preclinical characterization of nivolumab, for which antitumor activity and safety have been demonstrated in human clinical trials in various solid tumors.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To characterize cobimetinib pharmacokinetics and evaluate impact of clinically relevant covariates on cobimetinib pharmacokinetics.
METHODS: Plasma samples (N = 4886) were collected from 487 patients with various solid tumors (mainly melanoma) in three clinical studies (MEK4592g, NO25395, GO28141). Cobimetinib was administered orally, once daily on either a 21-day-on/7-day-off, 14-day-on/14-day-off or 28-day-on schedule in a 28-day dosing cycle as single agent or in combination with vemurafenib. Cobimetinib doses ranged from 2.1 to 125 mg. NONMEM was used for pharmacokinetic analysis.
RESULTS: A linear two-compartment model with first-order absorption, lag time and first-order elimination described cobimetinib pharmacokinetics. The typical estimates (inter-individual variability) of apparent clearance (CL/F), central volume of distribution (V2/F) and terminal half-life were 322 L/day (58 \%), 511 L (49 \%) and 2.2 days, respectively. Inter-occasion variability on relative bioavailability was estimated at 46 \%. CL/F decreased with age. V2/F increased with body weight (BWT). However, the impact of age and BWT on cobimetinib steady-state exposure (peak and trough concentrations and AUC following the recommended daily dose of 60 mg 21-day-on/7-day-off) was limited ({\textless}25 \% changes across the distribution of age and BWT). No significant difference in cobimetinib pharmacokinetics or steady-state exposure was observed between patient subgroups based on sex, renal function, ECOG score, hepatic function tests, race, region, cancer type, and co-administration of moderate and weak CYP3A inducers or inhibitors and vemurafenib.
CONCLUSION: A population pharmacokinetic model was developed for cobimetinib in cancer patients. Covariates had minimal impact on steady-state exposure, suggesting no need for dose adjustments and supporting the recommended dose for all patients.},

The objective was to assess whether doses higher than the phase III dose (15 mg/kg) might yield better efficacy without compromising the safety profile. Data were from 636 patients from the phase II and III NSCLC studies. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) models were fit to longitudinal tumor size data to estimate individual TGI metrics including time to tumor re-growth (TTG). Cox regression models were developed for time-to-event endpoints (progression-free survival (PFS), OS, and TTG) to investigate relationships with baseline prognostic factors and onartuzumab exposure. Incidence of adverse events was modeled by logistic regression. In the final models, higher onartuzumab exposure was associated with longer PFS, but not with longer OS. Longer OS was associated with higher baseline albumin, longer TTG, smaller number of metastatic sites, female gender, lower ECOG score, and younger age. TTG was the only TGI metric retained in the final OS model. Onartuzumab exposure was not significantly associated with TTG after adjusting for prognostic factors. Higher Cmin was associated with increased incidence of infusion reactions and peripheral edema. Higher onartuzumab exposure was not significantly associated with improved OS after adjusting for prognostic factors and TTG, and there was a trend of unknown clinical significance toward increased incidence of infusion reactions and peripheral edema. These results did not support testing higher onartuzumab doses.},

However, MF-UD has always shown inferior performance when compared with its competitors regarding number of patients treated at optimal doses. A consequence of using less effective designs is that more patients are treated with doses outside the therapeutic window. In June 2012, the U S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rejected the proposal to use Escalation with Overdose Control (EWOC), an established dose-finding method which has been extensively used in FDA-approved first in human trials and imposed a variation of the MF-UD, known as accelerated titration (AT) design. This event motivated us to perform an extensive simulation study comparing the operating characteristics of AT and EWOC. We show that the AT design has poor operating characteristics relative to three versions of EWOC under several practical scenarios. From the clinical investigator's perspective, lower bias and mean square error make EWOC designs preferable than AT designs without compromising safety. From a patient's perspective, uniformly higher proportion of patients receiving doses within an optimal range of the true MTD makes EWOC designs preferable than AT designs.},

	abstract = {Sharing of resources across organisations to support open innovation is an old idea, but which is being taken up by the scientific community at increasing speed, concerning public sharing in particular. The ability to address new questions or provide more precise answers to old questions through merged information is among the attractive features of sharing. Increased efficiency through reuse, and increased reliability of scientific findings through enhanced transparency, are expected outcomes from sharing. In the field of pharmacometrics, efforts to publicly share data, models and workflow have recently started. Sharing of individual-level longitudinal data for modelling requires solving legal, ethical and proprietary issues similar to many other fields, but there are also pharmacometric-specific aspects regarding data formats, exchange standards, and database properties. Several organisations (CDISC, C-Path, IMI, ISoP) are working to solve these issues and propose standards. There are also a number of initiatives aimed at collecting disease-specific databases – Alzheimer's Disease (ADNI, CAMD), malaria (WWARN), oncology (PDS), Parkinson's Disease (PPMI), tuberculosis (CPTR, TB-PACTS, ReSeqTB) – suitable for drug-disease modelling. Organized sharing of pharmacometric executable model code and associated information has in the past been sparse, but a model repository (DDMoRe Model Repository) intended for the purpose has recently been launched. In addition several other services can facilitate model sharing more generally. Pharmacometric workflows have matured over the last decades and initiatives to more fully capture those applied to analyses are ongoing. In order to maximize both the impact of pharmacometrics and the knowledge extracted from clinical data, the scientific community needs to take ownership of and create opportunities for open innovation.},

Following the introduction of the folic acid antagonists, corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine, there occurred an hiatus during which, although many agents were tested, little progress was made. Comparatively recently, the chemotherapy of acute leukemia has again advanced, this time in two directions. One has been the introduction of other effective antileukemic agents; the other parallels recent developments in the use of antibiotics, and might be termed "new ways with old drugs." An excellent review by Freireich and Frei of some of these advances has recently appeared.1},

The chapter explores that the panels are accelerating progress in the areas of organic chemistry, screening, pharmacology, biochemistry, and clinical investigation. Synthesis of new chemical compounds is proceeding in a number of directions, although most of the workers are making nucleic acid inhibitors and cytotoxic agents. The pharmaceutical industry and the university laboratories are furnishing thousands of chemical compounds for biological studies from their stock sources.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nivolumab (a programmed death 1 [PD-1] checkpoint inhibitor) and ipilimumab (a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 [CTLA-4] checkpoint inhibitor) have been shown to have complementary activity in metastatic melanoma. In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study, nivolumab alone or nivolumab plus ipilimumab was compared with ipilimumab alone in patients with metastatic melanoma.
METHODS: We assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, 945 previously untreated patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma to nivolumab alone, nivolumab plus ipilimumab, or ipilimumab alone. Progression-free survival and overall survival were coprimary end points. Results regarding progression-free survival are presented here.
RESULTS: The median progression-free survival was 11.5 months (95\% confidence interval [CI], 8.9 to 16.7) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, as compared with 2.9 months (95\% CI, 2.8 to 3.4) with ipilimumab (hazard ratio for death or disease progression, 0.42; 99.5\% CI, 0.31 to 0.57; P{\textless}0.001), and 6.9 months (95\% CI, 4.3 to 9.5) with nivolumab (hazard ratio for the comparison with ipilimumab, 0.57; 99.5\% CI, 0.43 to 0.76; P{\textless}0.001). In patients with tumors positive for the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1), the median progression-free survival was 14.0 months in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and in the nivolumab group, but in patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, progression-free survival was longer with the combination therapy than with nivolumab alone (11.2 months [95\% CI, 8.0 to not reached] vs. 5.3 months [95\% CI, 2.8 to 7.1]). Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 16.3\% of the patients in the nivolumab group, 55.0\% of those in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group, and 27.3\% of those in the ipilimumab group.
CONCLUSIONS: Among previously untreated patients with metastatic melanoma, nivolumab alone or combined with ipilimumab resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than ipilimumab alone. In patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, the combination of PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade was more effective than either agent alone.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a phase 1 dose-escalation study, combined inhibition of T-cell checkpoint pathways by nivolumab and ipilimumab was associated with a high rate of objective response, including complete responses, among patients with advanced melanoma.
METHODS: In this double-blind study involving 142 patients with metastatic melanoma who had not previously received treatment, we randomly assigned patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive ipilimumab (3 mg per kilogram of body weight) combined with either nivolumab (1 mg per kilogram) or placebo once every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab (3 mg per kilogram) or placebo every 2 weeks until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary end point was the rate of investigator-assessed, confirmed objective response among patients with BRAF V600 wild-type tumors.
RESULTS: Among patients with BRAF wild-type tumors, the rate of confirmed objective response was 61\% (44 of 72 patients) in the group that received both ipilimumab and nivolumab (combination group) versus 11\% (4 of 37 patients) in the group that received ipilimumab and placebo (ipilimumab-monotherapy group) (P{\textless}0.001), with complete responses reported in 16 patients (22\%) in the combination group and no patients in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group. The median duration of response was not reached in either group. The median progression-free survival was not reached with the combination therapy and was 4.4 months with ipilimumab monotherapy (hazard ratio associated with combination therapy as compared with ipilimumab monotherapy for disease progression or death, 0.40; 95\% confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.68; P{\textless}0.001). Similar results for response rate and progression-free survival were observed in 33 patients with BRAF mutation-positive tumors. Drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported in 54\% of the patients who received the combination therapy as compared with 24\% of the patients who received ipilimumab monotherapy. Select adverse events with potential immunologic causes were consistent with those in a phase 1 study, and most of these events resolved with immune-modulating medication.
CONCLUSIONS: The objective-response rate and the progression-free survival among patients with advanced melanoma who had not previously received treatment were significantly greater with nivolumab combined with ipilimumab than with ipilimumab monotherapy.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concurrent administration of the immune checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and ipilimumab has shown greater efficacy than either agent alone in patients with advanced melanoma, albeit with more high-grade adverse events. We assessed whether sequential administration of nivolumab followed by ipilimumab, or the reverse sequence, could improve safety without compromising efficacy.
METHODS: We did this randomised, open-label, phase 2 study at nine academic medical centres in the USA. Eligible patients (aged ≥18 years) with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma (treatment-naive or who had progressed after no more than one previous systemic therapy, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1) were randomly assigned (1:1) to induction with intravenous nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks for six doses followed by a planned switch to intravenous ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses, or the reverse sequence. Randomisation was done by an independent interactive voice response system with a permuted block schedule (block size four) without stratification factors. After induction, both groups received intravenous nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was treatment-related grade 3-5 adverse events until the end of the induction period (week 25), analysed in the as-treated population. Secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a response at week 25 and disease progression at weeks 13 and 25. Overall survival was a prespecified exploratory endpoint. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01783938, and is ongoing but no longer enrolling patients.
FINDINGS: Between April 30, 2013, and July 21, 2014, 140 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to nivolumab followed by ipilimumab (n=70) or to the reverse sequence of ipilimumab followed by nivolumab (n=70), of whom 68 and 70 patients, respectively, received at least one dose of study drug and were included in the analyses. The frequencies of treatment-related grade 3-5 adverse events up to week 25 were similar in the nivolumab followed by ipilimumab group (34 [50\%; 95\% CI 37·6-62·4] of 68 patients) and in the ipilimumab followed by nivolumab group (30 [43\%; 31·1-55·3] of 70 patients). The most common treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events during the whole study period were colitis (ten [15\%]) in the nivolumab followed by ipilimumab group vs 14 [20\%] in the reverse sequence group), increased lipase (ten [15\%] vs 12 [17\%]), and diarrhoea (eight [12\%] vs five [7\%]). No treatment-related deaths occurred. The proportion of patients with a response at week 25 was higher with nivolumab followed by ipilimumab than with the reverse sequence (28 [41\%; 95\% CI 29·4-53·8] vs 14 [20\%; 11·4-31·3]). Progression was reported in 26 (38\%; 95\% CI 26·7-50·8) patients in the nivolumab followed by ipilimumab group and 43 (61\%; 49·0-72·8) patients in the reverse sequence group at week 13 and in 26 (38\%; 26·7-50·8) and 42 (60\%; 47·6-71·5) patients at week 25, respectively. After a median follow-up of 19·8 months (IQR 12·8-25·7), median overall survival was not reached in the nivolumab followed by ipilimumab group (95\% CI 23·7-not reached), whereas over a median follow-up of 14·7 months (IQR 5·6-23·9) in the ipilimumab followed by nivolumab group, median overall survival was 16·9 months (95\% CI 9·2-26·5; HR 0·48 [95\% CI 0·29-0·80]). A higher proportion of patients in the nivolumab followed by ipilimumab group achieved 12-month overall survival than in the ipilimumab followed by nivolumab group (76\%; 95\% CI 64-85 vs 54\%; 42-65).
INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab followed by ipilimumab appears to be a more clinically beneficial option compared with the reverse sequence, albeit with a higher frequency of adverse events.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Immunotherapeutic agents produce antitumor effects by inducing cancer-specific immune responses or by modifying native immune processes. Resulting clinical response patterns extend beyond those of cytotoxic agents and can manifest after an initial increase in tumor burden or the appearance of new lesions (progressive disease). Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors or WHO criteria, designed to detect early effects of cytotoxic agents, may not provide a complete assessment of immunotherapeutic agents. Novel criteria for the evaluation of antitumor responses with immunotherapeutic agents are required.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The phase II clinical trial program with ipilimumab, an antibody that blocks CTL antigen-4, represents the most comprehensive data set available to date for an immunotherapeutic agent. Novel immune therapy response criteria proposed, based on the shared experience from community workshops and several investigators, were evaluated using data from ipilimumab phase II clinical trials in patients with advanced melanoma.
RESULTS: Ipilimumab monotherapy resulted in four distinct response patterns: (a) shrinkage in baseline lesions, without new lesions; (b) durable stable disease (in some patients followed by a slow, steady decline in total tumor burden); (c) response after an increase in total tumor burden; and (d) response in the presence of new lesions. All patterns were associated with favorable survival.
CONCLUSION: Systematic criteria, designated immune-related response criteria, were defined in an attempt to capture additional response patterns observed with immune therapy in advanced melanoma beyond those described by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors or WHO criteria. Further prospective evaluations of the immune-related response criteria, particularly their association with overall survival, are warranted.},

	abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies directed against the immune checkpoint protein cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4; CD152)—ipilimumab and tremelimumab—have been investigated in metastatic melanoma and other cancers and have shown promising results. Recently, ipilimumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. We review the literature on managing the adverse effects and kinetics of tumor regression with ipilimumab and provide guidelines on their management. During treatment with these antibodies, a unique set of adverse effects may occur, called immune-related adverse events (irAEs). These include rashes, which may rarely progress to life-threatening toxic epidermal necrolysis, and colitis, characterized by a mild to moderate, but occasionally also severe and persistent diarrhea. Hypophysitis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, iridocyclitis, lymphadenopathy, neuropathies, and nephritis have also been reported with ipilimumab. Early recognition of irAEs and initiation of treatment are critical to reduce the risk of sequelae. Interestingly, irAEs correlated with treatment response in some studies. Unique kinetics of response have been observed with CTLA-4 blockade with at least four patterns: (1) response in baseline lesions by week 12, with no new lesions seen; (2) stable disease, followed by a slow, steady decline in total tumor burden; (3) regression of tumor after initial increase in total tumor burden; and (4) reduction in total tumor burden during or after the appearance of new lesion(s) after week 12. We provide a detailed description of irAEs and recommendations for practicing oncologists who are managing them, along with the unusual kinetics of response associated with ipilimumab therapy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single-dose infusion of the agonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb) CP-870,893 accomplishes immune activation and clinical responses in patients with advanced cancers, but repeat dosing of this agent has not been reported.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled. The most common adverse event was transient, infusion-related cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Dose-limiting toxicities included grade 3 CRS and grade 3 urticaria; the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was estimated to be 0.2 mg/kg. Seven patients (26\%) had stable disease as the best clinical response; no partial or complete responses were observed. At the MTD, patient B lymphocytes exhibited persistently increased expression of costimulatory and adhesion molecules without resetting to baseline between doses. In 4 of 8 patients (50\%) evaluated at the MTD, there were marked declines in total CD3(+) T lymphocytes, as well as CD4(+) and CD8(+) subsets.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies received weekly intravenous infusions of CP-870,893 in four dose level cohorts. Safety and immune pharmacodynamics were assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: Weekly infusions of the agonist CD40 antibody CP-870,893 were well-tolerated, but there was little clinical activity in advanced cancer patients. Correlative studies demonstrate chronic B cell activation and in some patients, T cell depletion. Longer dosing intervals may be desirable for optimal immune pharmacodynamics.},

	abstract = {PurposeCD27, a costimulatory molecule on T cells, induces intracellular signals that mediate cellular activation, proliferation, effector function, and cell survival upon binding to its ligand, CD70. Varlilumab is a novel, first-in-class, agonist CD27 antibody that stimulates the CD27 pathway, which results in T-cell activation and antitumor activity in tumor models. This first-in-human, dose-escalation and expansion study evaluated the safety, pharmacology, and activity of varlilumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.MethodsIn a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design (n = 25), patients received a single dose of varlilumab (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 10 mg/kg intravenously) with a 28-day observation, followed by up to five multidose cycles (one dose per week for 4 weeks), depending on tumor response. Expansion cohorts were initiated at 3.0 mg/kg in patients with melanoma (n = 16) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC; n = 15). Primary objectives were to assess the safety and the maximum tolerated and optimal biologic doses of varlilumab. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical antitumor activity of varlilumab.ResultsExposure to varlilumab was linear and dose proportional across dose groups. Only one patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity—grade 3 transient asymptomatic hyponatremia at the 1.0-mg/kg dose level. Treatment-related adverse events were generally grade 1 or 2 in severity. Evidence of biologic activity consistent with CD27 stimulation—chemokine induction, T-cell stimulation, regulatory T cell depletion—was observed at all dose levels. A patient with metastatic RCC experienced a partial response (78\% shrinkage, progression-free survival {\textgreater} 2.3 years). Eight patients experienced stable disease {\textgreater} 3 months, including a patient with metastatic RCC with progression-free survival of {\textgreater} 3.9 years.ConclusionDose escalation of varlilumab to 10 mg/kg was well tolerated without identification of a maximum tolerated dose.

	abstract = {Absent adaptive, individualized dose-finding in early-phase oncology trials, subsequent registration trials risk suboptimal dosing that compromises statistical power and lowers the probability of technical success (PTS) for the investigational drug. While much methodological progress has been made toward adaptive dose-finding, and quantitative modeling of dose-response relationships, most such work continues to be organized around a concept of ?the? maximum tolerated dose (MTD). But a new methodology, Dose Titration Algorithm Tuning (DTAT), now holds forth the promise of individualized ?MTD
            
            ? dosing. Relative to such
            
            dosing, current ?one-size-fits-all? dosing practices amount to a
            
            that imposes
            
            on society. This paper estimates the magnitude of these costs.
            
            Simulated dose titration as in (Norris
            
            2017;6:112) is extended to 1000 subjects, yielding an empirical MTD
            
            distribution to which a gamma density is fitted. Individual-level efficacy, in terms of the probability of achieving remission, is assumed to be an E
            
            -type function of
            
            , scaled (arbitrarily) to identify MTD
            
            with the LD
            
            of the individual's tumor. (Thus, a criterion 50\% of the population achieve remission under individualized dosing in this analysis.) Current practice is modeled such that all patients receive a first-cycle dose at ?the? MTD, and those for whom MTD
            
            \&lt; MTD
            
            experience a ?dose-limiting toxicity? (DLT) that aborts subsequent cycles. Therapy thus terminated is assumed to confer no benefit. Individuals for whom MTD
            
            ? MTD
            
            tolerate a full treatment course, and achieve remission with probability determined by the E
            
            curve evaluated at MTD
            
            /MTD
            
            . A closed-form expression is obtained for the population remission rate, and maximized numerically over MTD
            
            as a free parameter, thus identifying the best result achievable under one-size-fits-all dosing.
            
            Simulated MTD
            
            follow a gamma distribution with shape parameter ? ? 1.75. The population remission rate under one-size-fits-all dosing at the maximizing value of MTD
            
            proves to be a function of the shape parameter ? and thus the coefficient of variation (CV) ? of the gamma distribution of MTD
            
            . Within a plausible range of CV(MTD
            
            ), one-size-fits-all dosing wastes approximately half of the drug's population-level efficacy.
            
            The CV of MTD
            
            determines the efficacy lost under one-size-fits-all dosing at ?the? MTD. Within plausible ranges for this CV, failure to individualize dosing can effectively halve a drug's value to society. In a competitive environment dominated by regulatory hurdles, this may reduce the value of shareholders' investment in the drug to

To increase understanding and communication, some simple graphical approaches to illustrating issues are proposed. It is also suggested that reducing variation in medical practice might make as big a contribution to improving health outcome as personalising its delivery according to the patient.

Nivolumab demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for various types of cancer. A time-varying clearance was identified for nivolumab. We show that the change of clearance over time is associated with the post-treatment effects: clearance decreases when disease status improves. This interaction between posttreatment effects and drug exposure may lead to a biased steep estimate of the exposure–response (E-R) relationship for efficacy. Under this scenario, simulations were performed to develop a proposed methodology to assess the causal effect of drug exposure upon clinical response. Data from nivolumab trials were subsequently used to verify the proposed methodology for E-R analysis. The results showed that E-R analysis results based on pharmacokinetic (PK) metrics derived from the first dose are more consistent with the true E-R or dose–response relationship than the steady-state PK metrics.},

Information useful for this purpose consists of certain population pharmacokinetic parameters (notably those describing the typical relationship between dosage and drug concentrations) and also measured drug concentrations from the individual of concern. Both types of information should be used. A (Bayesian) method that does so has been described in the pharmacokinetic literature. In this report an implementation of the Bayesian method that is readily adapted to a microcomputer is presented. Using simulated data it is compared with two other methods proposed by others, for estimating individual theophylline clearances. Both previously suggested methods are shown to be less precise than the Bayesian method: their typical error magnitudes are 20-70\% larger.},

	abstract = {Purpose:Neutropenia and subsequent infections are life-threatening treatment-related toxicities of chemotherapy. Among patients with cancer, hospitalizations related to neutropenic complications result in substantial medical costs, morbidity, and mortality. Previous estimates for the cost of cancer-related neutropenia hospitalizations are based on older and limited data. This study provides nationally representative estimates of the cost of cancer-related neutropenia hospitalizations.Methods:We examined data from the 2012 National Inpatient Sample and Kids’ Inpatient Database. Hospitalizations for cancer-related neutropenia were defined as those with a primary or secondary diagnosis of cancer and a diagnosis of neutropenia or a fever of unknown origin. We examined characteristics of cancer-related neutropenia hospitalizations among children (age {\textless} 18 years) and adults (age ≥ 18 years). Adjusted predicted margins were used to estimate length of stay and cost per stay.Results:There were 91,560 and 16,859 cancer-related neutropenia hospitalizations among adults and children, respectively. Total cost of cancer-related neutropenia hospitalizations was \$2.3 billion for adults and \$439 million for children. Cancer-related neutropenia hospitalizations accounted for 5.2\% of all cancer-related hospitalizations and 8.3\% of all cancer-related hospitalization costs. For adults, the mean length of stay for cancer-related neutropenia hospitalizations was 9.6 days, with a mean hospital cost of \$24,770 per stay. For children, the mean length of stay for cancer-related neutropenia hospitalizations was 8.5 days, with a mean hospital cost of \$26,000 per stay.Conclusion:We found the costs of cancer-related neutropenia hospitalizations to be substantially high. Efforts to prevent and minimize neutropenia-related complications among patients with cancer may decrease hospitalizations and associated costs.},

Fourteen randomized controlled trials provide the evidence base; earlier phase trials also informed recommendation development.RecommendationsNew or revised recommendations include the following. Regarding first-line treatment for patients with non–squamous cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma (without positive markers, eg, EGFR/ALK/ROS1), if the patient has high programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, pembrolizumab should be used alone; if the patient has low PD-L1 expression, clinicians should offer standard chemotherapy. All other clinical scenarios follow 2015 recommendations. Regarding second-line treatment in patients who received first-line chemotherapy, without prior immune checkpoint therapy, if NSCLC tumor is positive for PD-L1 expression, clinicians should use single-agent nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab; if tumor has negative or unknown PD-L1 expression, clinicians should use nivolumab or atezolizumab. All immune checkpoint therapy is recommended alone plus in the absence of contraindications. For patients who received a prior first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor, clinicians should offer standard chemotherapy. For patients who cannot receive immune checkpoint inhibitor after chemotherapy, docetaxel is recommended; in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, pemetrexed is recommended. In patients with a sensitizing EGFR mutation, disease progression after first-line epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, and T790M mutation, osimertinib is recommended; if NSCLC lacks the T790M mutation, then chemotherapy is recommended. Patients with ROS1 gene rearrangement without prior crizotinib may be offered crizotinib, or if they previously received crizotinib, they may be offered chemotherapy.},

	abstract = {PurposeMost crizotinib-treated patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK)–rearranged non–small-cell lung cancer (ALK-positive NSCLC) eventually experience disease progression. We evaluated two regimens of brigatinib, an investigational next-generation ALK inhibitor, in crizotinib-refractory ALK-positive NSCLC.Patients and MethodsPatients were stratified by brain metastases and best response to crizotinib. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to oral brigatinib 90 mg once daily (arm A) or 180 mg once daily with a 7-day lead-in at 90 mg (180 mg once daily [with lead-in]; arm B). Investigator-assessed confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was the primary end point.ResultsOf 222 patients enrolled (arm A: n = 112, 109 treated; arm B: n = 110, 110 treated), 154 (69\%) had baseline brain metastases and 164 of 222 (74\%) had received prior chemotherapy. With 8.0-month median follow-up, investigator-assessed confirmed ORR was 45\% (97.5\% CI, 34\% to 56\%) in arm A and 54\% (97.5\% CI, 43\% to 65\%) in arm B. Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was 9.2 months (95\% CI, 7.4 to 15.6) and 12.9 months (95\% CI, 11.1 to not reached) in arms A and B, respectively. Independent review committee–assessed intracranial ORR in patients with measurable brain metastases at baseline was 42\% (11 of 26 patients) in arm A and 67\% (12 of 18 patients) in arm B. Common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (arm A/B, 33\%/40\%), diarrhea (arm A/B, 19\%/38\%), headache (arm A/B, 28\%/27\%), and cough (arm A/B, 18\%/34\%), and were mainly grades 1 to 2. A subset of pulmonary adverse events with early onset (median onset: day 2) occurred in 14 of 219 treated patients (all grades, 6\%; grade ≥ 3, 3\%); none occurred after escalation to 180 mg in arm B. Seven of 14 patients were successfully retreated with brigatinib.ConclusionBrigatinib yielded substantial whole-body and intracranial responses as well as robust progression-free survival; 180 mg (with lead-in) showed consistently better efficacy than 90 mg, with acceptable safety.},

	abstract = {Male sex is associated with unfavourable pharmacokinetics and prognosis in elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We investigated higher rituximab doses for elderly male DLBCL patients. Elderly patients (61-80 years) received 6 cycles CHOP-14 (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone at 14-day intervals) and were randomized to 8 cycles rituximab (males 500 mg/m(2) , females 375 mg/m(2) ) every 2 weeks or according to an upfront dose-dense schedule. In 268 (120 females, 148 males) no difference between the standard and the upfront dose-dense rituximab schedule was found (3-year PFS 72\% vs. 74\%; OS 74\% vs. 77\%; P = 0.651). The 500 mg/m(2) dose of rituximab for male patients was associated with serum levels and exposure times slightly better than in females and a male/female hazard ratio of 0.9 for progression-free survival (PFS) and 0.8 for overall survival. For elderly males, 500 mg/m(2) was not more toxic than 375 mg/m(2) rituximab, but improved PFS by 32.5\% (P = 0.039), with a trend for a (30\%) better overall survival (P = 0.076) in a planned subgroup analysis adjusting for International Prognostic Index risk factors. We conclude that the higher rituximab dose for elderly male patients abrogated the adverse prognosis of male sex without increasing toxicity. In the era of personalized medicine, sex-specific pharmacokinetics and toxicities should be investigated for all drugs where these parameters impact on outcome.},

	issn = {1740-7753},
	doi = {10.1177/1740774517723829},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phase I trials are designed to determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended phase 2 dose of therapeutic agents for subsequent testing. The dose-finding paradigm has thus traditionally focused on identifying the maximum tolerable dose of an agent or combination therapy under the assumption that there is a non-decreasing relationship between dose-toxicity and dose-efficacy. The dose is typically determined based on the probability of severe toxicity observed during the first treatment cycle. A novel endpoint, the total toxicity profile, was previously developed to account for the multiple toxicity types and grades experienced in the first cycle. More recently, this was extended to a repeated measures design based on the total toxicity profile to account for longitudinal toxicities over multiple treatment cycles in the absence of within-patient correlation.
METHODS: In this work, we propose to extend the design in the presence of within-patient correlation. Furthermore, we provide a framework to detect a toxicity time trend (toxicity increasing, decreasing, or stable) over multiple treatment cycles. We utilize a linear mixed model in the Bayesian framework, with the addition of Bayesian risk functions for decision-making in dose assignment.
RESULTS: The performance of this design was evaluated using simulation studies and real data from a phase I trial. We demonstrated that using available toxicity data from all cycles of treatment improves the accuracy of maximum tolerated dose identification and allows for the detection of a time trend. The performance is consistent regardless of the strength of the within-patient correlation. In addition, the use of a quasi-continuous total toxicity profile score significantly increased the power to detect time trends compared to when binary data only were used.
CONCLUSION: The increased interest in molecularly targeted agents and immunotherapies in oncology necessitates innovative phase I study designs. Our proposed framework provides a tool to tackle some of the challenges presented by these novel agents, specifically through the ability to understand patterns of toxicity over time, which is important in the cases of cumulative or late toxicities.},

	abstract = {Phase I oncology trials are designed to identify a safe dose with an acceptable toxicity profile. The dose is typically determined based on the probability of severe toxicity observed during the first treatment cycle, although patients continue to receive treatment for multiple cycles. In addition, the toxicity data from multiple types and grades are typically summarized into a single binary outcome of dose-limiting toxicity. A novel endpoint, the total toxicity profile, was previously developed to account for the multiple toxicity types and grades. In this work, we propose to account for longitudinal repeated measures of total toxicity profile over multiple treatment cycles, accounting for cumulative toxicity during dosing-finding. A linear mixed model was utilized in the Bayesian framework, with addition of Bayesian risk functions for decision-making in dose assignment. The performance of this design is evaluated using simulation studies and compared with the previously proposed quasi-likelihood continual reassessment method (QLCRM) design. Twelve clinical scenarios incorporating four different locations of maximum tolerated dose and three different time trends (decreasing, increasing, and no effect) were investigated. The proposed repeated measures design was comparable with the QLCRM when only cycle 1 data were utilized in dose-finding; however, it demonstrated an improvement over the QLCRM when data from multiple cycles were used across all scenarios.

Such effects may contribute to the antitumor efficacy of chemotherapy in vivo and may delay or prevent the acquisition of drug-resistance by cancer cells. We have implemented a treatment regimen that augments the potential antivascular effects of chemotherapy, that is devoid of obvious toxic side effects, and that obstructs the development of drug resistance by tumor cells. Xenografts of 2 independent neuroblastoma cell lines were subjected to either continuous treatment with low doses of vinblastine, a monoclonal neutralizing antibody (DC101) targeting the flk-1/KDR (type 2) receptor for VEGF, or both agents together. The rationale for this combination was that any antivascular effects of the low-dose chemotherapy would be selectively enhanced in cells of newly formed vessels when survival signals mediated by VEGF are blocked. Both DC101 and low-dose vinblastine treatment individually resulted in significant but transient xenograft regression, diminished tumor vascularity, and direct inhibition of angiogenesis. Remarkably, the combination therapy resulted in full and sustained regressions of large established tumors, without an ensuing increase in host toxicity or any signs of acquired drug resistance during the course of treatment, which lasted for {\textgreater}6 months.

We show here that this antiangiogenic schedule avoided drug resistance and eradicated Lewis lung carcinoma and L1210 leukemia, an outcome not possible with the conventional schedule. When Lewis lung carcinoma and EMT-6 breast cancer were made drug resistant before therapy, the antiangiogenic schedule suppressed tumor growth 3-fold more effectively than the conventional schedule. When another angiogenesis inhibitor, TNP-470, was added to the antiangiogenic schedule of cyclophosphamide, drug-resistant Lewis lung carcinomas were eradicated. Each dose of the antiangiogenic schedule of cyclophosphamide induced the apoptosis of endothelial cells within tumors, and endothelial cell apoptosis preceded the apoptosis of drug-resistant tumor cells. This antiangiogenic effect was more pronounced in p53-null mice in which the apoptosis of p53-null endothelial cells induced by cyclophosphamide was so vigorous that drug-resistant tumors comprising 4.5\% of body weight were eradicated. Thus, by using a dosing schedule of cyclophosphamide that provided more sustained apoptosis of endothelial cells within the vascular bed of a tumor, we show that a chemotherapeutic agent can more effectively control tumor growth in mice, regardless of whether the tumor cells are drug resistant.},

Dosing recommendations for specific populations are often incomplete or unavailable at the time of drug approval. Currently, there is no regulatory framework to incorporate model-based dosing recommendations for specific populations. This paper proposes a scientific framework for using modeling and simulation to support specific population dosing recommendations. This framework creates a knowledgebase of drug and population attributes where model-based approaches can be developed to inform dosing recommendations. The framework may benefit patients by having reliable dosing information at the time of drug approval. Patients with conditions where studies are difficult to perform would benefit from dosing based on state-of-the-art knowledge. Industry and regulators would benefit from a scientific and efficient approach to improve specific population prediction. A research approach to determine specific population dose prediction is discussed along with challenges and risks. We hope to initiate a dialogue to explore the role of modeling based on data for drugs with similar clearance mechanisms to predict drug dosing.},

Although cereblon (CRBN) is an essential requirement for IMiD action, the complete molecular and biochemical mechanisms responsible for lenalidomide-mediated sensitivity or resistance remain unknown. Here, we report that IMiDs work primarily via inhibition of peroxidase-mediated intracellular H2O2 decomposition in MM cells. MM cells with lower H2O2-decomposition capacity were more vulnerable to lenalidomide-induced H2O2 accumulation and associated cytotoxicity. CRBN dependent degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3 was a consequence of H2O2- mediated oxidative stress. Lenalidomide increased intracellular H2O2 levels by inhibiting thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) in cells expressing CRBN, causing accumulation of immunoglobulin light chain dimers, significantly increasing endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inducing cytotoxicity by activation of BH3-only protein Bim in MM. Other direct inhibitors of TrxR and thioredoxin (Trx) caused similar cytotoxicity, but in a CRBN independent fashion. Our findings could help identify patients most likely to benefit from IMiDs and suggest direct TrxR or Trx inhibitors for MM therapy.},

Prior improvements in multiple myeloma (MM) survival were not fully observed in racial and ethnic minorities and older individuals. We hypothesized that improvements in MM management in recent years have reduced these disparities. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries to calculate the incidence and relative survival rates (RSRs) of MM in the United States for patients diagnosed from 1993 to 1997 (prethalidomide), 1998 to 2002 (introduction of thalidomide), 2003 to 2007 (bortezomib and lenalidomide), and 2008 to 2012 (upfront bortezomib and lenalidomide, early availability of carfilzomib and pomalidomide). MM incidence increased significantly among non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) and non-Hispanic black (NHB) men, but not among NHB women and Hispanics. Improvement in 5-year RSRs (1993-1997 vs 2008-2012) was seen among patients of all age and race/ethnicity groups. Ten-year RSRs (1993-1997 vs 2003-2007) improved for patients {\textless}65 years of age (19.6\%-35\%; P {\textless} .001), but not for patients ≥75 years of age (7.8\%-9.3\%; P = .3). Among patients 65 to 74 years of age, 10-year RSRs improved for NHWs (11.3\% vs 20.5\%; P {\textless} .001) and Hispanics (10.6\% vs 20.2\%; P = .02), but not for NHBs (12.6\% vs 19.5\%; P = .06.). These findings confirm consistent improvement in survival for MM patients and point to the challenge of further extending these improvements to older and minority patients.},

	doi = {10.1111/bcp.12878},
	abstract = {AIMS: Use of the anti-tumour antibiotic actinomycin D is associated with development of hepatotoxicity, particularly in young children. A paucity of actinomycin D pharmacokinetic data make it challenging to develop a sound rationale for defining dosing regimens in younger patients. The study aim was to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model using a combination of data from the literature and generated from experimental analyses.
METHODS: Assays to determine actinomycin D Log P, blood:plasma partition ratio and ABCB1 kinetics were conducted. These data were combined with physiochemical properties sourced from the literature to generate a compound file for use within the modelling-simulation software Simcyp (version 14 release 1). For simulation, information was taken from two datasets, one from 117 patients under the age of 21 and one from 20 patients aged 16-48.
RESULTS: The final model incorporated clinical renal and biliary clearance data and an additional systemic clearance value. The mean AUC0-26h of simulated subjects was within 1.25-fold of the observed AUC0-26h (84 ng h ml(-1) simulated vs. 93 ng h ml(-1) observed). For the younger age ranges, AUC predictions were within two-fold of observed values, with simulated data from six of the eight age/dose ranges falling within 15\% of observed data. Simulated values for actinomycin D AUC0-26h and clearance in infants aged 0-12 months ranged from 104 to 115 ng h ml(-1) and 3.5-3.8 l h(-1) , respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The model has potential utility for prediction of actinomycin D exposure in younger patients and may help guide future dosing. However, additional independent data from neonates and infants is needed for further validation. Physiological differences between paediatric cancer patients and healthy children also need to be further characterized and incorporated into PBPK models.},

The consideration of such pharmacokinetic variability supports optimal drug efficacy and safety for each single individual, e.g. by identification of individual-specific dosings. One clear objective in clinical drug development is therefore a thorough characterization of the physiological sources of interindividual variability. In this work, we present a Bayesian population physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) approach for the mechanistically and physiologically realistic identification of interindividual variability. The consideration of a generic and highly detailed mechanistic PBPK model structure enables the integration of large amounts of prior physiological knowledge, which is then updated with new experimental data in a Bayesian framework. A covariate model integrates known relationships of physiological parameters to age, gender and body height. We further provide a framework for estimation of the a posteriori parameter dependency structure at the population level. The approach is demonstrated considering a cohort of healthy individuals and theophylline as an application example. The variability and co-variability of physiological parameters are specified within the population; respectively. Significant correlations are identified between population parameters and are applied for individual- and population-specific visual predictive checks of the pharmacokinetic behavior, which leads to improved results compared to present population approaches. In the future, the integration of a generic PBPK model into an hierarchical approach allows for extrapolations to other populations or drugs, while the Bayesian paradigm allows for an iterative application of the approach and thereby a continuous updating of physiological knowledge with new data. This will facilitate decision making e.g. from preclinical to clinical development or extrapolation of PK behavior from healthy to clinically significant populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: From a previously validated paediatric population pharmacokinetic model, it was derived that non-linear morphine maintenance doses of 5 μg/kg(1.5)/h, with a 50 \% dose reduction in neonates with a postnatal age (PNA) {\textless}10 days, yield similar morphine and metabolite concentrations across patients younger than 3 years. Compared with traditional dosing, this model-derived dosing regimen yields significantly reduced doses in neonates aged {\textless}10 days.
METHODS: Concentration predictions of the population model were prospectively evaluated in postoperative term neonates and infants up to the age of 1 year who received morphine doses according to the model-derived algorithm. The efficacy of this dosing algorithm was evaluated using morphine rescue medication and actual average infusion rates.
RESULTS: Morphine and metabolite concentrations were accurately predicted by the paediatric pharmacokinetic morphine model. With regard to efficacy, 5 out of 18 neonates (27.8 \%) with a PNA of {\textless}10 days needed rescue medication versus 18 of the 20 older patients (90 \%) (p = 0.06). The median (interquartile range [IQR]) total morphine rescue dose was 0 (0-20) μg/kg in younger patients versus 193 (19-362) μg/kg in older patients (p = 0.003). The median (IQR) actual average morphine infusion rate was 4.4 (4.0-4.8) μg/kg/h in younger patients versus 14.4 (11.3-23.4) μg/kg/h in older patients (p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Morphine paediatric dosing algorithms corrected for pharmacokinetic differences alone yield effective doses that prevent over-dosing for neonates with a PNA {\textless}10 days. The fact that many neonates and infants with a PNA ≥10 days still required rescue medication warrants pharmacodynamic studies to further optimize the dosing algorithm for these patients.},

	abstract = {Individualization of drug therapy, described as tailoring drug selection and drug dosing to a given patient, has been an objective of physicians and other health-care providers for centuries. An understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, the mechanism of action of the drug, and exposure–response relationships provides the framework for individualization. There are many approaches to individualization: selecting an antibiotic based on minimum effective concentrations and bacterial sensitivity, population (sparse sample) pharmacokinetics, therapeutic drug monitoring and, more recently, pharmacogenomics. The goal of individualization is to optimize the efficacy of a drug, minimize its toxicity, or both. With the growth of technology and databases, drug–disease–trial models and simulation have become useful for integrating information from many different domains. Physiology-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models have provided a mechanistic approach to individualization, and clinical trial designs such as those involving enrichment have also enabled individualization. In the future, “-omics” technologies, vaccines, ex vivo gene therapy, and the so-called “diseases-in-a-dish” will provide additional strategies to achieve individualization.

In this study, the applicability of the Bayesian method to individualize tacrolimus dose was prospectively examined. Twenty adult recipients (Bayesian group) and another 20 adult patients (control group), all of whom underwent living-donor liver transplantation, were enrolled in this study. In the Bayesian group, the dose of tacrolimus during the first 3 and 4 weeks after surgery was adjusted with the Bayesian method using a population pharmacokinetic model, targeting a trough level of 5 to 12 ng/mL. The interindividual variability in tacrolimus concentrations was significantly reduced in the Bayesian group compared with the control group (average percentage coefficient of variation for all occasions, 32\% vs 44\% and 31\% vs 39\% in the first 3 and 4 weeks, respectively). In addition, more patients achieved the target concentrations in the Bayesian group than in the control group (average for all occasions, 85\% vs 59\% and 83\% vs 70\% in the first 3 and 4 weeks, respectively). These findings suggest that the Bayesian method can be used to calculate maintenance doses of tacrolimus in adult patients early after living-donor liver transplantation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: At present, there is no rational approach for choosing a dosing strategy for individualization based on a covariate. An approach to use in establishment of an a priori dosing strategy for individualization is presented. Factors influencing the choice of such a dosing strategy are identified.
METHODS: The approach requires definition of the following: target variable, seriousness of deviations from the target (ie, risk function), population model, covariate distributions, and constraints. Minimizing the total risk yields an optimal dosing strategy, estimated as dose sizes for different subpopulations and covariate cutoff values at which doses are increased or decreased. The method was illustrated with the use of simulated and real drug examples for the situation in which clearance is related to creatinine clearance.
RESULTS: The estimated optimal cutoff(s) paralleled the median creatinine clearance in the population. The extent of variability in clearance explained by creatinine clearance was the main factor influencing the optimal ratios between adjacent dose sizes. An optimal dosing strategy was possible to estimate for the real drug.
CONCLUSIONS: The method is simple to perform, although one difficulty lies in defining the target variable and risk function. Our results imply that commonly used constraints in dosing strategies based on renal function (ie, dose ratio of 2 and predetermined cutoffs) are nonoptimal in the sense we propose. Because an optimal dosing strategy may not be practical to use, the therapeutic cost that would result with any constraint can be assessed by comparison of the outcome after the desired and the optimal strategy.},

Based on the simulated interaction between ticagrelor 180 mg and ritonavir 100 mg, a lower dose of ticagrelor was calculated to obtain, when coadministered with ritonavir, the same pharmacokinetic (PK) and platelet inhibition as ticagrelor administered alone. A clinical study was thereafter conducted in healthy volunteers. Observed PK profiles of ticagrelor and its AM were successfully predicted with the model. Platelet inhibition was nearly complete in both sessions despite administration of a fourfold lower dose of ticagrelor in the second session.

Many patients fail during induction and others respond initially but relapse during maintenance therapy. Although anti-drug antibodies (ADA) are associated with some clinical failures, there is evidence that some failures may be due to subtherapeutic exposure. Adapting doses based on clinical outcomes and trough concentrations can improve response and reduce the proportion that develop ADA, but identification of appropriate doses in the presence of time-varying patient factors is complicated. Several adaptive dosing strategies (label recommendations versus therapeutic drug monitoring with an established stepwise algorithm or proportional dose adjustments or Bayesian population pharmacokinetic model-based dosing) were simulated on a virtual population (constructed with time-varying covariates and random effects on individual pharmacokinetic parameters) using R to assess their relative performance. Strategies were evaluated on their ability to maintain trough infliximab concentrations above an established target, 3 mg/L, during maintenance phase. Model-based dosing was superior in maintaining target trough concentrations, showing individuals in maintenance achieving concentrations above the target faster and a lower proportion of individuals who developed ADA. Model-based dosing results were consistent across a range of baseline covariate groups. This in silico assessment of adaptive dosing strategies demonstrated that, when challenged with dynamic covariate and random effect changes occurring in individual pharmacokinetic parameters, model-based approaches were superior to other strategies. Model-based dosing has not been tested clinically; however, the potential benefits of model-based dosing for infliximab suggest that it should be investigated to reduce subtherapeutic exposure.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Busulfan dose adjustment is routinely guided by plasma concentration monitoring using 4-9 blood samples per dose adjustment, but a pharmacometric Bayesian approach could reduce this sample burden.
METHODS: The authors developed a nonparametric population model with Pmetrics. They used it to simulate optimal initial busulfan dosages, and in a blinded manner, they compared dosage adjustments using the model in the BestDose software to dosage adjustments calculated by noncompartmental estimation of area under the time-concentration curve at a national reference laboratory in a cohort of patients not included in model building.
RESULTS: Mean (range) age of the 53 model-building subjects was 7.8 years (0.2-19.0 years) and weight was 26.5 kg (5.6-78.0 kg), similar to nearly 120 validation subjects. There were 16.7 samples (6-26 samples) per subject to build the model. The BestDose cohort was also diverse: 10.2 years (0.25-18 years) and 46.4 kg (5.2-110.9 kg). Mean bias and imprecision of the 1-compartment model-predicted busulfan concentrations were 0.42\% and 9.2\%, and were similar in the validation cohorts. Initial dosages to achieve average concentrations of 600-900 ng/mL were 1.1 mg/kg (≤12 kg, 67\% in the target range) and 1.0 mg/kg ({\textgreater}12 kg, 76\% in the target range). Using all 9 concentrations after dose 1 in the Bayesian estimation of dose requirements, the mean (95\% confidence interval) bias of BestDose calculations for the third dose was 0.2\% (-2.4\% to 2.9\%, P = 0.85), compared with the standard noncompartmental method based on 9 concentrations. With 1 optimally timed concentration 15 minutes after the infusion (calculated with the authors' novel MMopt algorithm) bias was -9.2\% (-16.7\% to -1.5\%, P = 0.02). With 2 concentrations at 15 minutes and 4 hours bias was only 1.9\% (-0.3\% to 4.2\%, P = 0.08).
CONCLUSIONS: BestDose accurately calculates busulfan intravenous dosage requirements to achieve target plasma exposures in children up to 18 years of age and 110 kg using only 2 blood samples per adjustment compared with 6-9 samples for standard noncompartmental dose calculations.},

	abstract = {Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) provides valuable guidance for dose adjustment of antibiotics, immunosuppressives, antiepileptics, and other drugs, but its use for traditional anticancer therapies has been limited. Perhaps the most important obstacle is the impractical requirement of multiple blood samples to adequately define systemic exposure of drugs that have a short elimination half-life and are given by intermittent intravenous injections. However, the newer targeted anticancer therapies have different pharmacokinetic (PK) and dosing characteristics compared with traditional cytotoxic drugs, making it possible to estimate the steady-state drug exposure with a single trough-level measurement. Recent evidence indicates that certain PK parameters, including trough levels, are correlated with clinical outcomes for many of these agents, including imatinib, sunitinib, rituximab, and cetuximab. Although the current evidence is insufficient to mandate TDM in routine practice, a concerted investigation should be encouraged to determine whether the steady-state trough measurements of targeted agents will have a practical place in the clinical care of patients with cancer.},

	doi = {10.1001/jama.2013.282542},
	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Some new drug applications fail because of inadequate drug performance and others are not approved because the information submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is unsatisfactory to make that determination. Resubmission of failed applications is costly, delaying marketing approval and the availability of new drugs to patients.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the reasons that FDA marketing approval for new drugs was delayed or denied.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective review of FDA documents and extraction of data were performed. We examined all drug applications first submitted to the FDA between 2000 and 2012 for new molecular entities (NMEs), which are active ingredients never before marketed in the United States in any form. Using FDA correspondence and reviews, we investigated the reasons NMEs failed to obtain FDA approval.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reasons for delayed FDA approval or nonapproval of NME applications.
RESULTS: Of the 302 identified NME applications, 151 (50\%) were approved when first submitted and 222 (73.5\%) were ultimately approved. Seventy-one applications required 1 or more resubmissions before approval, with a median delay to approval of 435 days following the first unsuccessful submission. Of the unsuccessful first-time applications, 24 (15.9\%) included uncertainties related to dose selection, 20 (13.2\%) choice of study end points that failed to adequately reflect a clinically meaningful effect, 20 (13.2\%) inconsistent results when different end points were tested, 17 (11.3\%) inconsistent results when different trials or study sites were compared, and 20 (13.2\%) poor efficacy when compared with the standard of care. The frequency of safety deficiencies was similar among never-approved drugs compared with those with delayed approval (43 of 80 never approved [53.8\%] vs 37 of 71 eventually approved [52.1\%]; difference, 1.7\% [95\% CI, -14.86\% to 18.05\%]; P = .87). However, efficacy deficiencies were significantly more frequent among the never-approved drugs than among those with delayed approvals (61 of 80 never approved [76.3\%] vs 28 of 71 eventually approved [39.4\%]; difference, 36.9\% [95\% CI, 20.25\% to 50.86\%]; P {\textless} .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Several potentially preventable deficiencies, including failure to select optimal drug doses and suitable study end points, accounted for significant delays in the approval of new drugs. Understanding the reasons for previous failures is helpful to improve the efficiency of clinical development for new drugs.},

However, clinical application of the model-based personalized vancomycin therapy is still limited. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the clinical utility and safety of a model-based patient-tailored dose of vancomycin in neonates. A model-based vancomycin dosing calculator, developed from a population pharmacokinetic study, has been integrated into the routine clinical care in 3 neonatal intensive care units (Robert Debré, Cochin Port Royal, and Clocheville hospitals) between 2012 and 2014. The target attainment rate, defined as the percentage of patients with a first therapeutic drug monitoring serum vancomycin concentration achieving the target window of 15 to 25 mg/liter, was selected as an endpoint for evaluating the clinical utility. The safety evaluation was focused on nephrotoxicity. The clinical application of the model-based patient-tailored dose of vancomycin has been demonstrated in 190 neonates. The mean (standard deviation) gestational and postnatal ages of the study population were 31.1 (4.9) weeks and 16.7 (21.7) days, respectively. The target attainment rate increased from 41\% to 72\% without any case of vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity.

	abstract = {Despite the documented benefit of voriconazole therapeutic drug monitoring, nonlinear pharmacokinetics make the timing of steady-state trough sampling and appropriate dose adjustments unpredictable by conventional methods. We developed a nonparametric population model with data from 141 previously richly sampled children and adults. We then used it in our multiple-model Bayesian adaptive control algorithm to predict measured concentrations and doses in a separate cohort of 33 pediatric patients aged 8 months to 17 years who were receiving voriconazole and enrolled in a pharmacokinetic study. Using all available samples to estimate the individual Bayesian posterior parameter values, the median percent prediction bias relative to a measured target trough concentration in the patients was 1.1\% (interquartile range, -17.1 to 10\%). Compared to the actual dose that resulted in the target concentration, the percent bias of the predicted dose was -0.7\% (interquartile range, -7 to 20\%). Using only trough concentrations to generate the Bayesian posterior parameter values, the target bias was 6.4\% (interquartile range, -1.4 to 14.7\%; P = 0.16 versus the full posterior parameter value) and the dose bias was -6.7\% (interquartile range, -18.7 to 2.4\%; P = 0.15). Use of a sample collected at an optimal time of 4 h after a dose, in addition to the trough concentration, resulted in a nonsignificantly improved target bias of 3.8\% (interquartile range, -13.1 to 18\%; P = 0.32) and a dose bias of -3.5\% (interquartile range, -18 to 14\%; P = 0.33). With the nonparametric population model and trough concentrations, our control algorithm can accurately manage voriconazole therapy in children independently of steady-state conditions, and it is generalizable to any drug with a nonparametric pharmacokinetic model.

In this paper, we present a new class of designs for cancer phase I trials which initially rapidly escalate by allowing multiple doses (usually 3) to be assigned to each cohort of patients. The class of designs, called the LMH-CRM (an extension of the continual reassessment method (CRM) by administering different percentiles of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), denoted 'low', 'medium', 'high'), is proven to be consistent and coherent (a commonsense property of phase I trials for dose escalation and de-escalation). Three designs (slow, moderate and fast) are derived based on different dose-escalation restrictions. Simulation results show that moderate and fast LMH-CRM combine the advantages of the CRM with one patient per cohort and three patients per cohort: it accurately estimates the MTD; controls overall toxicity rates; and is time efficient.},

Endpoints need to reflect benefit to patients, and show that changes in tumour size either in absolute terms (response and progression) or relative to control (progression) are clinically relevant. Improvements in trial design should be accompanied by improvements in available endpoints.

	abstract = {PurposeThe current dose-finding methodology for estimating the maximum tolerated dose of investigational anticancer agents is based on the cytotoxic chemotherapy paradigm. Molecularly targeted agents (MTAs) have different toxicity profiles, which may lead to more long-lasting mild or moderate toxicities as well as to late-onset and cumulative toxicities. Several approved MTAs have been poorly tolerated during long-term administration, leading to postmarketing dose optimization studies to re-evaluate the optimal treatment dose. Using data from completed bortezomib dose-finding trials, we explore its toxicity profile, optimize its dose, and examine the appropriateness of current designs for identifying an optimal dose.Patients and MethodsWe classified the toxicities captured from 481 patients in 14 bortezomib dose-finding studies conducted through the National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, computed the incidence of late-onset toxicities, and compared the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) among groups of patients receiving different doses of bortezomib.ResultsA total of 13,008 toxicities were captured: 46\% of patients’ first DLTs and 88\% of dose reductions or discontinuations of treatment because of toxicity were observed after the first cycle. Moreover, for the approved dose of 1.3 mg/m2, the estimated cumulative incidence of DLT was {\textgreater} 50\%, and the estimated cumulative incidence of dose reduction or treatment discontinuation because of toxicity was nearly 40\%.ConclusionsWhen considering the entire course of treatment, the approved bortezomib dose exceeds the conventional ceiling DLT rate of 20\% to 33\%. Retrospective analysis of trial data provides an opportunity for dose optimization of MTAs. Future dose-finding studies of MTAs should take into account late-onset toxicities to ensure that a tolerable dose is identified for future efficacy and comparative trials.},

	abstract = {The outcome of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related lymphomas (ARLs) has improved since the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy, but median survival remains low. We studied dose-adjusted EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin) with suspension of antiretroviral therapy in 39 newly diagnosed ARLs and examined protein expression profiles associated with drug resistance and histogenesis, patient immunity, and HIV dynamics and mutations. The expression profiles from a subset of ARL cases were also compared with a matched group of similarly treated HIV-negative cases. Complete remission was achieved in 74\% of patients, and at 53 months median follow-up, disease-free and overall survival are 92\% and 60\%, respectively. Following reinstitution of antiretroviral therapy after chemotherapy, the CD4+ cells recovered by 12 months and the viral loads decreased below baseline by 3 months. Compared with HIV-negative cases, the ARL cases had lower bcl-2 and higher CD10 expression, consistent with a germinal center origin and good prognosis, but were more likely to be highly proliferative and to express p53, adverse features with standard chemotherapy. Unlike HIV-negative cases, p53 overexpression was not associated with a poor outcome, suggesting different pathogenesis. High tumor proliferation did not correlate with poor outcome and may partially explain the high activity of dose-adjusted EPOCH. The results suggest that the improved immune function associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may have led to a shift in pathogenesis away from lymphomas of post-germinal center origin, which have a poor prognosis. These results suggest that tumor pathogenesis is responsible for the improved outcome of ARLs in the era of HAART.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma is a distinct subtype of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma that is closely related to nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients are usually young and present with large mediastinal masses. There is no standard treatment, but the inadequacy of immunochemotherapy alone has resulted in routine consolidation with mediastinal radiotherapy, which has potentially serious late effects. We aimed to develop a strategy that improves the rate of cure and obviates the need for radiotherapy.
METHODS: We conducted a single-group, phase 2, prospective study of infusional dose-adjusted etoposide, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide with vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) and filgrastim without radiotherapy in 51 patients with untreated primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. We used results from a retrospective study of DA-EPOCH-R from another center to independently verify the outcomes.
RESULTS: The patients had a median age of 30 years (range, 19 to 52) and a median tumor diameter of 11 cm; 59\% were women. During a median of 5 years of follow-up, the event-free survival rate was 93\%, and the overall survival rate was 97\%. Among the 16 patients who were involved in the retrospective analysis at another center, over a median of 3 years of follow-up, the event-free survival rate was 100\%, and no patients received radiotherapy. No late morbidity or cardiac toxic effects were found in any patients. After follow-up ranging from 10 months to 14 years, all but 2 of the 51 patients (4\%) who received DA-EPOCH-R alone were in complete remission. The 2 remaining patients received radiotherapy and were disease-free at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with DA-EPOCH-R obviated the need for radiotherapy in patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00001337.).},

	abstract = {Biomarkers for more precise patient care are needed in metastatic prostate cancer. We have reported a phase II trial (TOPARP-A) of the PARP inhibitor olaparib in metastatic prostate cancer, demonstrating antitumor activity associating with homologous recombination DNA repair defects. We now report targeted and whole-exome sequencing of serial circulating free DNA (cfDNA) samples collected during this trial. Decreases in cfDNA concentration independently associated with outcome in multivariable analyses (HR for overall survival at week 8: 0.19; 95\% CI, 0.06–0.56; P = 0.003). All tumor tissue somatic DNA repair mutations were detectable in cfDNA; allele frequency of somatic mutations decreased selectively in responding patients (χ2 P {\textless} 0.001). At disease progression, following response to olaparib, multiple subclonal aberrations reverting germline and somatic DNA repair mutations (BRCA2, PALB2) back in frame emerged as mechanisms of resistance. These data support the role of liquid biopsies as a predictive, prognostic, response, and resistance biomarker in metastatic prostate cancer.
SIGNIFICANCE: We report prospectively planned, serial, circulating free DNA (cfDNA) analyses from patients with metastatic prostate cancer treated on an investigator-initiated phase II trial of olaparib. These analyses provide predictive, prognostic, response, and resistance data with “second hit” mutations first detectable at disease progression, suggesting clonal evolution from treatment-selective pressure and platinum resistance.

	abstract = {The 3 + 3 design is the most common choice among clinicians for phase I dose-escalation oncology trials. In recent reviews, more than 95\% of phase I trials have been based on the 3 + 3 design. Given that it is intuitive and its implementation does not require a computer program, clinicians can conduct 3 + 3 dose escalations in practice with virtually no logistic cost, and trial protocols based on the 3 + 3 design pass institutional review board and biostatistics reviews quickly. However, the performance of the 3 + 3 design has rarely been compared with model-based designs in simulation studies with matched sample sizes. In the vast majority of statistical literature, the 3 + 3 design has been shown to be inferior in identifying true maximum-tolerated doses (MTDs), although the sample size required by the 3 + 3 design is often orders-of-magnitude smaller than model-based designs. In this article, through comparative simulation studies with matched sample sizes, we demonstrate that the 3 + 3 design has higher risks of exposing patients to toxic doses above the MTD than the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design, a newly developed adaptive method. In addition, compared with the mTPI design, the 3 + 3 design does not yield higher probabilities in identifying the correct MTD, even when the sample size is matched. Given that the mTPI design is equally transparent, costless to implement with free software, and more flexible in practical situations, we highly encourage its adoption in early dose-escalation studies whenever the 3 + 3 design is also considered. We provide free software to allow direct comparisons of the 3 + 3 design with other model-based designs in simulation studies with matched sample sizes.},

	abstract = {In phase I clinical trials, experimental drugs are administered to healthy volunteers in order to establish their safety and to explore the relationship between the dose taken and the concentration found in plasma. Each volunteer receives a series of increasing single doses. In this paper a Bayesian decision procedure is developed for choosing the doses to give in the next round of the study, taking into account both prior information and the responses observed so far. The procedure seeks the optimal doses for learning about the dose-concentration relationship, subject to a constraint which reduces the risk of administering dangerously high doses. Individual volunteers receive more than one dose, and the pharmacokinetic responses observed are, after logarithmic transformation, treated as approximately normally distributed. Thus data analysis can be achieved by fitting linear mixed models. By expressing prior information as 'pseudo-data', and by maximizing over posterior distributions rather than taking expectations, a procedure which can be implemented using standard mixed model software is derived. Comparisons are made with existing approaches to the conduct of these studies, and the new method is illustrated using real and simulated data.To whom correspondence should be addressed.},

Because of inter-ethnic heterogeneity, the dosage established in a landmark trial for a certain population may not be generalizable to a different ethnic population, and a follow-up bridge trial is often needed to find the maximum tolerated dose for the new population. We propose the bridging continual reassessment method (B-CRM) to facilitate dose finding for such follow-up bridge trials. The B-CRM borrows information from the landmark trial through a novel estimate of the dose-toxicity curve and accommodates the inter-ethnic heterogeneity using the Bayesian model averaging approach. Extensive simulation studies show that the B-CRM has desirable operating characteristics with a high probability to select the target dose. This article focuses on ethnic heterogeneity, but the proposed method can be directly used to handle other types of patient heterogeneity, for example, patient subgroups defined by prognostic factors or biomarkers.

	doi = {10.1177/1740774508096474},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: An extensive literature has covered the statistical properties of the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) and the modifications of this method. While there are some applications of CRM designs in recent Phase I trials, the standard method (SM) of escalating doses after three patients with an option for an additional three patients SM remains very popular, mainly due to its simplicity. From a practical perspective, clinicians are interested in designs that can estimate the MTD using fewer patients for a fixed number of doses, or can test more dose levels for a given sample size.
PURPOSE: This article compares CRM-based methods with the SM in terms of the number of patients needed to reach the MTD, total sample size required, and trial duration.
METHODS: The comparisons are performed under two alternative schemes: a fixed or a varying sample approach with the implementation of a stopping rule. The stopping rule halts the trial if the confidence interval around the MTD is within a pre-specified bound. Our simulations evaluated several CRM-based methods under different scenarios by varying the number of dose levels from five to eight and the location of the true MTD.
RESULTS: CRM and SM are comparable in terms of how fast they reach the MTD and the total sample size required when testing a limited number of dose levels ({\textless}or=5), but as the number of dose levels increases, CRM reaches the MTD in fewer patients when used with a fixed sample of 20 patients. However, a sample size of 20-25 patients is not sufficient to achieve a narrow precision around the estimated toxicity rate at the MTD.
LIMITATIONS: We focused on methods with practical design features that are of interest to clinicians. However, there are several alternative CRM-based designs that are not investigated in this manuscript, and hence our results are not generalizable to other designs.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that CRM-based methods are an improvement over the SM in terms of accuracy and optimal dose allocation in almost all cases, except when the true dose is among the lower levels.},

	abstract = {Patients and prescribers need to be fully informed regarding the safety profile of approved medications. This includes knowledge and information regarding whether an adverse event of interest exhibits a potential dose-response relationship. In order to thoroughly evaluate whether an adverse event rate increases with increasing dose level, evidence from multiple clinical trials needs to be combined and analyzed. The various clinical trials that need to be combined often include different dose levels. If one evaluates the dose-response relationship by including only the trials with all of the common dose levels, this will lead to the exclusion of potentially several clinical trials as well as dose levels, and thus the loss of important information. Other methods, such as crudely pooling patients on the same dose level across different studies, are subject to bias due to the breakdown of randomization. It is preferable to include all studies and relevant dose levels, even if all studies do not contain the same dose levels. Bayesian methodology has been shown to be useful in the context of indirect and mixed treatment comparison methods, to combine information from different therapies in different studies in order to make treatment effect inferences. This type of approach is foundational to the models presented here, but instead of modeling different dose arms in different studies, we extend the methodology to allow for assessment of the dose-response relationship across multiple clinical trials. In this paper, we propose three Bayesian indirect/mixed treatment comparison models to assess adverse event dose-response relationships. These three models are designed to handle binary responses and time to event responses. We apply the methods to real data sets and demonstrate that our proposed methods are useful in discovering potential dose-response relationships.},

	abstract = {The paradigm of oncology drug development is expanding from developing cytotoxic agents to developing biological or molecularly targeted agents (MTAs). Although it is common for the efficacy and toxicity of cytotoxic agents to increase monotonically with dose escalation, the efficacy of some MTAs may exhibit non-monotonic patterns in their dose–efficacy relationships. Many adaptive dose-finding approaches in the available literature account for the non-monotonic dose–efficacy behavior by including additional model parameters. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive dose-finding approach based on binary efficacy and toxicity outcomes in phase I trials for monotherapy using an MTA. We develop a dose–efficacy model, the parameters of which are allowed to change in the vicinity of the change point of the dose level, in order to consider the non-monotonic pattern of the dose–efficacy relationship. The change point is obtained as the dose that maximizes the log-likelihood of the assumed dose–efficacy and dose-toxicity models. The dose-finding algorithm is based on the weighted Mahalanobis distance, calculated using the posterior probabilities of efficacy and toxicity outcomes. We compare the operating characteristics between the proposed and existing methods and examine the sensitivity of the proposed method by simulation studies under various scenarios.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Docetaxel plus prednisone is standard first-line chemotherapy for men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Aflibercept is a recombinant human fusion protein that binds A and B isoforms of VEGF and placental growth factor, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis. We assessed whether the addition of aflibercept to docetaxel and prednisone would improve overall survival in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer compared with the addition of placebo to docetaxel and prednisone.
METHODS: VENICE was a phase 3, multicentre, randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group study done in 31 countries (187 sites). Men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, adequate organ function, and no prior chemotherapy were treated with docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) intravenously every 3 weeks) and oral prednisone (5 mg twice daily) and randomly allocated (1:1) to receive aflibercept (6 mg/kg) or placebo, intravenously, every 3 weeks. Treatment allocation was done centrally via an interactive voice response system, using a computer-generated sequence with a permuted-block size of four and stratified according Eastern Co-operative Group performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients, investigators, and other individuals responsible for study conduct and data analysis were masked to treatment assignment. Aflibercept or placebo vials were supplied in identical boxes. The primary endpoint was overall survival using intention-to-treat analysis. This is the primary analysis of the completed trial. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00519285 FINDINGS: Between Aug 17, 2007, and Feb 11, 2010, 1224 men were randomly allocated to treatment: 612 to each group. At final analysis, median follow-up was 35 months (IQR 29-41) and 873 men had died. Median overall survival was 22·1 months (95·6\% CI 20·3-24·1) in the aflibercept group and 21·2 months (19·6-23·8) in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio 0·94, 95·6\% CI 0·82-1·08; p=0·38). We recorded a higher incidence of grade 3-4 gastrointestinal disorders (182 [30\%] vs 48 [8·0\%]), haemorrhagic events (32 [5·2\%] vs ten [1·7\%]), hypertension (81 [13\%] vs 20 [3·3\%]), fatigue (97 [16\%] vs 46 [7·7\%]), infections (123 [20\%] vs 60 [10\%]) and treatment-related fatal adverse events (21 [3·4\%] vs nine [1·5\%]) in the aflibercept group than in the placebo group.
INTERPRETATION: Aflibercept in combination with docetaxel and prednisone given as first-line chemotherapy for men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer resulted in no improvement in overall survival and added toxicity compared with placebo. Docetaxel plus prednisone remains the standard treatment for such men who need first-line chemotherapy.

MTAs can benefit from new trial designs that allow inclusion of low-grade toxicities, late-onset toxicities, addition of an efficacy endpoint, and flexibility in the specification of a target toxicity probability. To study the degree of adoption of these methods, we conducted a Web of Science search of articles published between 2008 and 2014 that describe phase 1 oncology trials. Trials were categorized based on the dose-finding design used and the type of drug studied. Out of 1,712 dose-finding trials that met our criteria, 1,591 (92.9\%) utilized a rule-based design, and 92 (5.4\%; range 2.3\% in 2009 to 9.7\% in 2014) utilized a model-based or novel design. Over half of the trials tested an MTA or immunotherapy. Among the MTA and immunotherapy trials, 5.8\% used model-based methods, compared to 3.9\% and 8.3\% of the chemotherapy or radiotherapy trials, respectively. While the percentage of trials using novel dose-finding designs has tripled since 2007, the adoption of these designs continues to remain low.},

	doi = {10.1200/JCO.2005.03.184},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Pertuzumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody (2C4), binds to extracellular domain II of the HER-2 receptor and blocks its ability to dimerize with other HER receptors. Pertuzumab represents a new class of targeted therapeutics known as HER dimerization inhibitors. A clinical study was conducted to investigate safety and pharmacokinetics of pertuzumab and to perform a preliminary assessment of HER dimerization inhibition as a treatment strategy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with incurable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic solid tumors that had progressed during or after standard therapy were recruited to a dose-escalation study of pertuzumab (0.5 to 15 mg/kg) given intravenously every 3 weeks.
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients received pertuzumab and 19 completed at least two cycles. Pertuzumab was well tolerated. Overall, 365 adverse events were reported and 122 considered to be possibly drug related. Of these, 116 were of grade 1 to 2 intensity. The pharmacokinetics of pertuzumab were similar to other humanized immunoglobulin G antibodies, supporting a 3-week dosing regimen. Trough plasma concentrations were in excess of target concentrations at doses greater than 5 mg/kg. Two patients, one with ovarian cancer (5.0 mg/kg) and one with pancreatic islet cell carcinoma (15.0 mg/kg), achieved a partial response. Responses were documented by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors after 1.5 and 6 months of pertuzumab therapy, and lasted for 11 and 10 months, respectively. Stable disease lasting for more than 2.5 months (range, 2.6 to 5.5 months) was observed in six patients.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that pertuzumab is well tolerated, has a pharmacokinetic profile which supports 3-week dosing, and is clinically active, suggesting that inhibition of dimerization may be an effective anticancer strategy.},

In contrast, progress for people with cancer has been incremental over the past few decades, although we have recently witnessed improved outcomes in some cancers, owing in part to the development of new therapies. Gains in our fundamental understanding of disease biology, coupled with careful clinical investigations, led to remarkable success in HIV and for certain cancers.

	volume = {122},
	issn = {1097-0142},
	doi = {10.1002/cncr.29908},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior research has identified unrealistic optimism as a bias that might impair informed consent among patient-subjects in early-phase oncology trials. However, optimism is not a unitary construct; it also can be defined as a general disposition, or what is called dispositional optimism. The authors assessed whether dispositional optimism would be related to high expectations for personal therapeutic benefit reported by patient-subjects in these trials but not to the therapeutic misconception. The authors also assessed how dispositional optimism related to unrealistic optimism.
METHODS: Patient-subjects completed questionnaires designed to measure expectations for therapeutic benefit, dispositional optimism, unrealistic optimism, and the therapeutic misconception.
RESULTS: Dispositional optimism was found to be significantly associated with higher expectations for personal therapeutic benefit (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [r], 0.333; P{\textless}.0001), but was not associated with the therapeutic misconception (Spearman r, -0.075; P = .329). Dispositional optimism was found to be weakly associated with unrealistic optimism (Spearman r, 0.215; P = .005). On multivariate analysis, both dispositional optimism (P = .02) and unrealistic optimism (P{\textless}.0001) were found to be independently associated with high expectations for personal therapeutic benefit. Unrealistic optimism (P = .0001), but not dispositional optimism, was found to be independently associated with the therapeutic misconception.
CONCLUSIONS: High expectations for therapeutic benefit among patient-subjects in early-phase oncology trials should not be assumed to result from misunderstanding of specific information regarding the trials. The data from the current study indicate that these expectations are associated with either a dispositionally positive outlook on life or biased expectations concerning specific aspects of trial participation. Not all manifestations of optimism are the same, and different types of optimism likely have different consequences for informed consent in early-phase oncology research.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This phase I study endeavored to estimate the maximum tolerated dose and describe the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of oral irinotecan with gefitinib in children with refractory solid tumors.
METHODS: Oral irinotecan was administered on days 1-5 and 8-12 with oral gefitinib (fixed dose, 150 mg/m(2)/day) on days 1-12 of a 21-day course. The escalation with overdose control method guided irinotecan dose escalation (7 dose levels, range 5-40 mg/m(2)/day).
RESULTS: Sixteen of 19 patients were evaluable, with serial pharmacokinetic studies in ten patients. Diagnoses included osteosarcoma (N = 5), neuroblastoma (N = 3), sarcoma (N = 3), and others (N = 5). Patients received a median of two courses (range 1-20), with at least two patients treated on dose levels 2-7. Three patients had five DLTs; the most common being metabolic (hypokalemia, N = 2 and hypophosphatemia, N = 1) at dose levels two (10 mg/m(2)) and four (20 mg/m(2)). One patient experienced grade 3 diarrhea (40 mg/m(2)). Irinotecan bioavailability was 2.5-fold higher when co-administered with gefitinib, while the conversion rate of irinotecan to SN-38 lactone was unaffected. The study closed due to poor accrual before evaluation of the next recommended irinotecan dose level (35 mg/m(2)). Of 11 patients receiving at least two courses of therapy, three had stable disease lasting two to four courses and one patient maintained a complete response through 18 courses.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of oral gefitinib and irinotecan has acceptable toxicity and anti-tumor activity in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors. Pharmacokinetic analysis confirms that co-administration of gefitinib increases irinotecan bioavailability leading to an increased SN-38 lactone systemic exposure.},

Children and families face major inequity between countries in terms of access to innovative drugs in development. Hurdles and bottlenecks are well known-eg, small numbers of patients, the complexity of developing targeted agents and their biomarkers for selected patients, limitations of US and EU regulations for paediatric medicines, insufficient return on investment, and the global economic crisis facing drug companies. New drug development pathways could efficiently address the challenges with innovative methods and trial designs, investment in biology and preclinical research, new models of partnership and funding including public-private partnerships and precompetitive research consortia, improved regulatory requirements, initiatives and incentives that better address these needs, and increased collaboration between paediatric oncology cooperative groups worldwide.

First, designs that were developed in order to relax the rules for more flexible inclusions. Second, methods to incorporate data emerging from adult studies. Third, designs accounting for toxicity evaluation at repeated cycles in pediatric oncology.

	abstract = {Phase 1 oncology trials are critical to improving the treatment of cancer. Critics have raised 2 fundamental ethical challenges about phase 1 cancer research: the paucity of benefits with substantial risks and poor-quality informed consent. Despite 3 decades of controversy about phase 1 oncology research, there is little critical analysis of the arguments or of the data relevant to these questions. Existing but old data reveal that about 5\% of patients in phase 1 trials experience shrinkage of their tumor, with a 0.5\% mortality rate. In some notable cases, patients in phase 1 trials have been cured or sustained long-term remissions. Limited data suggest that patients in phase 1 trials may have better quality of life than comparable patients receiving supportive care. More important, the risks and benefits of phase 1 trials are not clearly worse than risk-benefit ratios used by the US Food and Drug Administration to approve chemotherapeutic agents for clinical use. The objections based on informed consent are deficiencies of disclosure, understanding, and voluntariness. The available data do not support the claim that disclosure is deficient. Although studies evaluating patient understanding have substantial methodological problems, they demonstrate that more than 70\% of patients understand that they may not directly benefit even when they hope they will personally benefit. Finally, a closer look at issues of voluntariness reveals that patients with advanced cancer who participate in phase 1 research may have a different set of values than do critics and are not coerced. Overall, it appears that phase 1 oncology trials satisfy the requirement for a favorable risk-benefit ratio and that patients who enroll provide adequate informed consent.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to gather qualitative feedback on patient perceptions of informed consent forms and elicit recommendations to improve readability and utility for enhanced patient safety and engagement in shared decision making.
METHODS: Sixty interviews in personal interviews were conducted consisting of a literacy and numeracy assessment, a comprehension quiz to assess retention of key information, and open-ended questions to determine reactions, clarity of information, and suggestions for improvement.
RESULTS: Although 68\% of the participants had education beyond high school, many still missed comprehension questions and found the forms difficult to read. Recurrent suggestions included specific formatting changes to enhance readability, a need for additional sources of information, mixed attitudes toward inclusion of risk information, and the recognized importance of physician-patient conversations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence from the patient perspective that consent forms are too complex and fail to achieve comprehension. Future studies should be conducted using patients' suggestions for form redesign and inclusion of supplemental educational tools to optimize communication and safety to achieve more informed health care decision making.},

The performance of the current nonclinical safety-testing scheme was discussed, highlighting current strengths and areas for improvement. While current nonclinical testing appears to predict the clinical outcome where the prevalence of specific adverse effects are high, nonclinical testing becomes less reliable for predicting clinical adverse effects that occur infrequently, as with some kinase inhibitors. Although adverse effects associated with kinase inhibitors can often be predicted on the basis of target biology, drugs can be promiscuous and inhibit targets with poorly defined function and associated risks. Improvements in adverse effect databases and better characterization of the biologic activities of drug targets may enable better use of computational modeling approaches in predicting adverse effects with kinase inhibitors. Assessing safety of a lead candidate in parallel with other drug properties enables incorporation of a molecule's best features during chemical design, eliminates the worst molecules early, and permits timely investigation/characterization of toxicity mechanisms for identified liabilities. A safety lead optimization and candidate identification strategy that reduces intrinsic toxicity and metabolic risk and enhances selectivity can deliver selective kinase inhibitors that demonstrate on-target adverse effects identified nonclinically. Integrating clinical and nonclinical data during drug development can facilitate better identification and management of oncology drugs. Follow-up nonclinical studies may be used to better understand the risks in a given patient population and minimize or manage these risks more appropriately.

In an effort to shift the current paradigm in dose and regimen selection and highlight the availability and usefulness of well-established and regulatory-acceptable methods, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in collaboration with the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Association (EFPIA) hosted a multistakeholder workshop on dose finding (London 4-5 December 2014). Some methodologies that could constitute a toolkit for drug developers and regulators were presented. These methods are described in the present report: they include five advanced methods for data analysis (empirical regression models, pharmacometrics models, quantitative systems pharmacology models, MCP-Mod, and model averaging) and three methods for study design optimization (Fisher information matrix (FIM)-based methods, clinical trial simulations, and adaptive studies). Pairwise comparisons were also discussed during the workshop; however, mostly for historical reasons. This paper discusses the added value and limitations of these methods as well as challenges for their implementation. Some applications in different therapeutic areas are also summarized, in line with the discussions at the workshop. There was agreement at the workshop on the fact that selection of dose for phase III is an estimation problem and should not be addressed via hypothesis testing. Dose selection for phase III trials should be informed by well-designed dose-finding studies; however, the specific choice of method(s) will depend on several aspects and it is not possible to recommend a generalized decision tree. There are many valuable methods available, the methods are not mutually exclusive, and they should be used in conjunction to ensure a scientifically rigorous understanding of the dosing rationale.},

In this paper, we develop an overarching methodology to perform efficient multiple comparisons and modeling for dose finding, under uncertainty about the dose-response shape, using general parametric models. The framework described here is quite broad and can be utilized in situations involving for example generalized nonlinear models, linear and nonlinear mixed effects models, Cox proportional hazards models, with the main restriction being that a univariate dose-response relationship is modeled, that is, both dose and response correspond to univariate measurements. In addition to the core framework, we also develop a general purpose methodology to fit dose-response data in a computationally and statistically efficient way. Several examples illustrate the breadth of applicability of the results. For the analyses, we developed the R add-on package DoseFinding, which provides a convenient interface to the general approach adopted here.},

Adaptive designs are now well established in cancer but much less so in other clinical areas. A phase I study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetic profile and antiretroviral efficacy of C34‐PEG4‐Chol, a novel peptide fusion inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection, has been set up with Medical Research Council funding. During the study workup, Bayesian adaptive designs based on the continual reassessment method were compared with a more standard rule‐based design, with the aim of choosing a design that would maximise the scientific information gained from the study. The process of specifying and evaluating the design options was time consuming and required the active involvement of all members of the trial's protocol development team. However, the effort was worthwhile as the originally proposed rule‐based design has been replaced by a more efficient Bayesian adaptive design. While the outcome to be modelled, design details and evaluation criteria are trial specific, the principles behind their selection are general.

Despite extensive research, mortality rates for sepsis have not substantially improved in the last several decades. We describe an innovative phase II clinical trial design for evaluating the addition of L-carnitine to the treatment of vasopressor-dependent septic shock.
DESIGN: The design incorporates a variety of features to increase efficiency, including a normal dynamic linear dose-response model, adaptive randomization, and early stopping for futility or success based on the probability that a future phase III trial using a 28-day mortality outcome would be successful.
SETTING: Trial design and computer simulation of a trial to be conducted in the emergency department and ICU.
INTERVENTIONS: Proposed to study intravenous L-carnitine.
MEASUREMENTS: The proposed trial uses an early endpoint, the 48-hour change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, to drive adaptive randomization and dose selection.
MAIN RESULTS: We use existing data to model the expected relationship between the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment change and the 28-day mortality to determine the trial's operating characteristics using Monte Carlo simulation.
CONCLUSIONS: The resulting trial efficiently identifies the best dose of L-carnitine and provides clear guidance regarding whether to continue development into phase III.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: It is increasingly clear that definitions of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) established for phase 1 trials of cytotoxic agents are not suitable for molecularly targeted agents because of specific toxicity profiles. An international survey collected expertise on the definition of DLT, as part of an initiative aimed at presenting new guidelines for phase 1 trials of targeted agents.
METHODS: A 15-question survey was sent to corresponding authors of phase 1 reports. Questions involved: duration of the DLT assessment period, incorporation of specific grade 1 (G1) or G2 toxicity and their minimum duration to qualify as DLT, exclusion of specific G3 and inclusion of dose modification/delay.
RESULTS: Among the 400 investigators contacted, 93 replied of whom 65 completed the questionnaires. A total of 87\% opted for an extended DLT assessment period beyond cycle 1, with the proviso not to delay patient accrual. Reanalysis at the end of the study of all safety data was proposed in order to recommend the phase 2 dose. Most respondents (92\%) suggested including dose modification in the definition of DLT when dose intensity was decreased to 70\%. Whilst moderate toxicity was deemed relevant by 70\%, the G1/2 toxicities selected to define DLT however varied.
CONCLUSION: The majority of experts favoured a longer DLT assessment period as well as incorporation of specific G2 toxicities into the DLT definition. However, no clear consensus existed on a re-definition of DLT. Therefore analyses of a large international data warehouse were also used to develop guidelines presented in a companion paper.},

Methods We performed a systematic review of MEDLINE and EMBASE, limiting studies to single-agent phase I trials recruiting adults and published after 2006. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were performed by two reviewers. Data were assessed descriptively, and associations were tested by univariable and multivariable logistic regression.  Results We identified 611 unique phase I cancer trials, of which 149 (24\%) included an expansion cohort. The trials were significantly more likely to use an expansion cohort if they were published more recently, were multicenter, or evaluated a noncytotoxic agent. Objectives of the expansion cohort were reported in 74\% of trials. In these trials, safety (80\%), efficacy (45\%), pharmacokinetics (28\%), pharmacodynamics (23\%), and patient enrichment (14\%) were cited as objectives. Among expansion cohorts with safety objectives, the recommended phase II dose was modified in 13\% and new toxicities were described in 54\% of trials. Among trials aimed at assessing efficacy, only 11\% demonstrated antitumor activity assessed by response criteria that was not previously observed during dose escalation.  Conclusion The utilization of expansion cohorts has increased with time. Safety and efficacy are common objectives, but 26\% fail to report explicit aims. Expansion cohorts may provide useful supplementary data for phase I trials, particularly with regard to toxicity and definition of recommended dose for phase II studies.},

	abstract = {BackgroundIn a randomized, double-blind phase II trial in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), axitinib versus placebo titration yielded a significantly higher objective response rate. We evaluated pharmacokinetic and blood pressure (BP) data from this study to elucidate relationships among axitinib exposure, BP change, and efficacy.Patients and methodsPatients received axitinib 5 mg twice daily during a lead-in period. Patients who met dose-titration criteria were randomized 1:1 to stepwise dose increases with axitinib or placebo. Patients ineligible for randomization continued without dose increases. Serial 6-h and sparse pharmacokinetic sampling were carried out; BP was measured at clinic visits and at home in all patients, and by 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) in a subset of patients.ResultsArea under the plasma concentration–time curve from 0 to 24 h throughout the course of treatment (AUCstudy) was higher in patients with complete or partial responses than those with stable or progressive disease in the axitinib-titration arm, but comparable between these groups in the placebo-titration and nonrandomized arms. In the overall population, AUCstudy and efficacy outcomes were not strongly correlated. Mean BP across the population was similar when measured in clinic, at home, or by 24-h ABPM. Weak correlations were observed between axitinib steady-state exposure and diastolic BP. When grouped by change in diastolic BP from baseline, patients in the ≥10 and ≥15 mmHg groups had longer progression-free survival.ConclusionsOptimal axitinib exposure may differ among patients with mRCC. Pharmacokinetic or BP measurements cannot be used exclusively to guide axitinib dosing. Individualization of treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including axitinib, is thus more complex than anticipated and cannot be limited to a single clinical factor.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Statistical simulations have consistently demonstrated that new dose-escalation designs such as accelerated titration design (ATD) and continual reassessment method (CRM)-type designs outperform the standard "3+3" design in phase I cancer clinical trials.
METHODS: We evaluated the actual efficiency of different dose escalation methods employed in first-in-human phase I clinical trials of targeted agents administered as single agents published over the last decade.
RESULTS: Forty-nine per cent of the 84 retrieved trials used the standard "3+3" design. Newer designs used included ATD in 42\%, modified CRM [mCRM] in 7\%, and pharmacologically guided dose escalation in 1\%. The median numbers of dose levels explored in trials using "3+3", ATD and mCRM designs were 6, 8 and 10, respectively. More strikingly, the mean MTD to starting dose ratio appeared to be at least twice as high for trials using mCRM or ATD designs as for trials using a standard "3+3" design. Despite this, the mean number of patients exposed to a dose below the MTD was similar in trials using "3+3", ATD and mCRM designs.
CONCLUSION: Our results support a more extensive implementation of innovative dose escalation designs such as mCRM and ATD in phase I cancer clinical trials of molecularly targeted agents.},

Experimental DesignIn the 3+3 dose-escalation component of this phase 1 study (NCT02517398), eligible patients with advanced solid tumors received M7824 at 1, 3, 10, or 20 mg/kg once-every-2-weeks until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, or trial withdrawal; additionally, a cohort received an initial 0.3 mg/kg dose to evaluate pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), followed by 10 mg/kg dosing. The primary objective is to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD); secondary objectives include PK, immunogenicity, and best overall response. Results: Nineteen heavily pretreated patients with ECOG 0-1 have received M7824. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 4 patients (skin infection secondary to localized bullous pemphigoid, asymptomatic lipase increase, colitis with associated anemia, and gastroparesis with hypokalemia). The MTD was not reached. M7824 saturated peripheral PD-L1 and sequestered any released plasma TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3 throughout the dosing period at {\textgreater}1 mg/kg. There were signs of efficacy across all dose levels, including 1 ongoing confirmed complete response (cervical cancer), 2 durable confirmed partial responses (PRs; pancreatic cancer; anal cancer), 1 near-PR (cervical cancer), and 2 cases of prolonged stable disease in patients with growing disease at study entry (pancreatic cancer; carcinoid). Conclusions: M7824 has a manageable safety profile in patients with heavily pretreated advanced solid tumors. Early signs of efficacy are encouraging and multiple expansion cohorts are ongoing in a range of tumors.},

	abstract = {AIM: To evaluate dosing and intervention strategies for the phase II programme of a VEGF receptor inhibitor using PK-PD modelling and simulation, with the aim of maximizing (i) the number of patients on treatment and (ii) the average dose level during treatment.
METHODS: A previously developed PK-PD model for lenvatinib (E7080) was updated and parameters were re-estimated (141 patients, once daily and twice daily regimens). Treatment of lenvatinib was simulated for 16 weeks, initiated at 25 mg once daily. Outcome measures included the number of patients on treatment and overall drug exposure. A hypertension intervention design proposed for phase II studies was evaluated, including antihypertensive treatment and dose de-escalation. Additionally, a within-patient dose escalation was investigated, titrating up to 50 mg once daily unless unacceptable toxicity occurred.
RESULTS: Using the proposed antihypertension intervention design, 82\% of patients could remain on treatment, and the mean dose administered was 21.5 mg day⁻¹. The adverse event (AE) guided dose titration increased the average dose by 4.6 mg day⁻¹, while only marginally increasing the percentage of patients dropping out due to toxicity (from 18\% to 20.8\%).
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed hypertension intervention design is expected to be effective in maintaining patients on treatment with lenvatinib. The AE-guided dose titration with blood pressure as a biomarker yielded a higher overall dose level, without relevant increases in toxicity. Since increased exposure to lenvatinib seems correlated with increased treatment efficacy, the adaptive treatment design may thus be a valid approach to improve treatment outcome.},

	abstract = {Cancer immunotherapy has transformed the treatment of cancer. However, increasing use of immune-based therapies, including the widely used class of agents known as immune checkpoint inhibitors, has exposed a discrete group of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Many of these are driven by the same immunologic mechanisms responsible for the drugs’ therapeutic effects, namely blockade of inhibitory mechanisms that suppress the immune system and protect body tissues from an unconstrained acute or chronic immune response. Skin, gut, endocrine, lung and musculoskeletal irAEs are relatively common, whereas cardiovascular, hematologic, renal, neurologic and ophthalmologic irAEs occur much less frequently. The majority of irAEs are mild to moderate in severity; however, serious and occasionally life-threatening irAEs are reported in the literature, and treatment-related deaths occur in up to 2\% of patients, varying by ICI. Immunotherapy-related irAEs typically have a delayed onset and prolonged duration compared to adverse events from chemotherapy, and effective management depends on early recognition and prompt intervention with immune suppression and/or immunomodulatory strategies. There is an urgent need for multidisciplinary guidance reflecting broad-based perspectives on how to recognize, report and manage organ-specific toxicities until evidence-based data are available to inform clinical decision-making. The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) established a multidisciplinary Toxicity Management Working Group, which met for a full-day workshop to develop recommendations to standardize management of irAEs. Here we present their consensus recommendations on managing toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.},

	abstract = {TPS3630Background: Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that blocks several protein kinases involved in angiogenesis and oncogenesis. It was recently shown to provide a survival benefit in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Despite the observed benefits, toxicities such as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES- which occurs early in the first 1-2 weeks) and fatigue have limited its use. Multiple practices across the US adopted various dosing or interval scheduling despite the absence of supportive data. Methods: ReDOS (NCT02368886) is an Academic and Community Cancer Research United (ACCRU) network-led randomized phase II study of lower dose regorafenib compared to standard dose regorafenib in patients with refractory mCRC. Patients are randomized 1:1 to receive an escalating dose (Arm A: 80 mg daily Week 1, 120 mg daily Week 2,160 mg daily week 3 then 1 week off followed by Cycle 2) vs. standard dose (Arm B: 160 mg daily for 21 days/then 1 week off). Within each treatment arm, patients are further randomized to receive either pre-emptive or reactive Clobetasol for prevention/treatment of PPES (sub-arms A1, A2, B1 and B2). Eligibility criteria include histologically confirmed mCRC, ECOG ≤ 1, acceptable organ function, and patients must have failed all standard regimens including appropriate biologics. The primary endpoint is the 8 week planned continuation rate defined as the proportion of patients in each arm who complete 2 cycles of treatment and who intend to initiate cycle 3 if no progression is noted. Assuming an 8-week planned continuation rate of 75\% in the control group (B), and desiring an improvement to 90\% in the experimental group (A), a one-sided test with alpha = 0.20 and power of 80\% will require a sample size of 110 patients enrolled to both regorafenib arms (A and B) with 28 patients randomized to treatment sub-arm (A1, A2, B1, B2). An additional 10 patients will be enrolled to account for dropout, cancellations, ineligibles, etc, to give a total sample size of 120 patients. The total study duration is expected to be approximately 2 years. Clinical trial information: NCT02368886.},

As a result, there is a growing need to ensure trials are published when completed. There are limited data on the publication rate and the factors associated with publication in phase I trials. Methods The ClinicalTrials.gov database was searched for completed adult phase I cancer trials with reported results. PubMed was searched for matching publications published prior to April 1, 2017. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with unpublished trials. Linear regression was used to explore factors associated with time lag from study database lock to publication for published trials. Results The study cohort included 319 trials. 95 (30\%) trials had no matching publication. Thirty (9\%) trials were not published in abstract form as well. On multivariable analysis, the most significant factor associated with unpublished trials was industry funding (odds ratio 3.3, 95\% confidence interval 1.7-6.6, p=0.019). For published trials, time lag between database lock and publication was longer by 10.9 months (standard error 3.6, p{\textless}0.001) for industry funded trials compared with medical center funded trials. Conclusions Timely publishing of early cancer clinical trials results remains unsatisfactory. Industry funded phase I cancer trials were more likely to remain unpublished, and were associated with a longer time lag from database lock to publication. Policies that promote transparency and data sharing in clinical trial research might improve accountability among industry and investigators and improve timely results publication.},

Traditionally, phase I trial designs are rule-based, but for several years there is a trend towards model-based designs. Simulations have shown that model-based designs perform better, faster and are safer to establish the RP2D than rule-based designs. However, the superiority of model-based designs has never been confirmed based on true trial performance in practice. To aid evidence-based decisions for designing phase I trials, we compared publications of model-based and rule-based phase I trials in oncology. We reviewed 172 trials that have been published in the last 2 years and assessed the following operating characteristics: efficiency (trial duration, population size, dose-levels), patient safety (dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)) and treatment optimality (percentage of patients treated below and at or above the recommended phase 2 dose). Our results showed a non-significant but clinically relevant difference in trial duration. Model-based trials needed 10 months less than rule-based trials (26 versus 36 months; p = 0.25). Additionally, fewer patients were treated at dose-levels below the RP2D (31 \% versus 40 \%; p = 0.73) while safety was preserved (13 \% DLTs versus 14 \% DLTs). In this review, we provide evidence to encourage the use of model-based designs for future phase I studies, based on a median of 10 months of time gain, acceptable toxicity rates and minimization of suboptimal treatment.},

	abstract = {Background:
Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor with survival benefit in refractory mCRC patients (pts). Toxicities such as Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES), fatigue and hypertension (HTN) have limited its use. Despite absence of supportive data, various dosing or interval scheduling have been implemented into clinical practice.
Methods:
A randomized phase II study of regorafenib dose-escalation (Arm A: 80 mg/day, weekly dose escalation if no significant drug-related toxicities, up to 160 mg/day) vs. standard dose (Arm B: 160 mg/day) in pts with mCRC for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. Pts were randomized 1:1:1:1 to arms A1 and B1 (Pre-emptive Clobetasol for PPES); A2 and B2 (Reactive Clobetasol). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who completed 2 cycles of treatment and initiated the 3rd in Arm A (Pooled A1 + A2) vs. Arm B (Pooled B1 + B2). Superiority for Arm A was to be declared if the one-sided p-value calculated using Fisher’s exact method was less than 0.2.
Results:
From June 2015 to June 2017, 123 pts were randomized with 116 (A = 54, B = 62) evaluable for the primary endpoint. Demographic data were well balanced with overall median age of 61yrs (range: 29-81), M/F (61/39\%) and ECOG PS 0/1 (37/63\%) and KRAS MT/WT/UNK (47/44/9\%).The study met its primary endpoint with 43\% of pts on Arm A initiating the 3rd vs. only 25\% of pts Arm B [one-sided p-value 0.028]. Median Overall Survival (OS) was improved in Arm A vs. Arm B (9.0 mos vs. 5.9 mos; p = 0.094). Median Progression Free Survival (PFS) was 2.5 mos for Arm A vs. 2.0 mos for Arm B (p=0.553). Overall rates of grade 3/4 toxicity were more favorable for Arm A vs. Arm B (\% PPES 15 vs. 16, HTN 7 vs. 15 and fatigue 13 vs. 18, respectively). Multiple QOL parameters were improved in A vs. B primarily at week 2 of the first cycle.
Conclusion:
A strategy with weekly dose escalation of regorafenib from 80 mg to 160 mg/day was found to be superior to a starting dose of 160 mg/day. These results establish a new standard for optimizing regorafenib dosing. Further data on outcomes of preemptive vs. reactive clobetasol strategies are undergoing analysis and will be presented later. Clinical trial information: NCT02368886},

This normal approximation-based method can be looked as a Wald type confidence interval for a binomial proportion, the survival probability, using the “effective” sample size defined by Cutler and Ederer. Wald-type binomial confidence interval has been shown to perform poorly comparing to other methods. We choose three methods of binomial confidence intervals for the construction of confidence interval for survival probability: Wilson's method, Agresti–Coull's method, and higher-order asymptotic likelihood method. The methods of “effective” sample size proposed by Peto et al. and Dorey and Korn are also considered. The Greenwood formula is far from satisfactory, while confidence intervals based on the three methods of binomial proportion using Cutler and Ederer's “effective” sample size have much better performance.},

A cornerstone of the revised strategy was to focus decision-making on five technical determinants (the right target, right tissue, right safety, right patient and right commercial potential). In this article, we describe the progress made using this '5R framework' in the hope that our experience could be useful to other companies tackling R\&D productivity issues. We focus on the evolution of our approach to target validation, hit and lead optimization, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and drug safety testing, which have helped improve the quality of candidate drug nomination, as well as the development of the right culture, where 'truth seeking' is encouraged by more rigorous and quantitative decision-making. We also discuss where the approach has failed and the lessons learned. Overall, the continued evolution and application of the 5R framework are beginning to have an impact, with success rates from candidate drug nomination to phase III completion improving from 4\% in 2005–2010 to 19\% in 2012–2016.},

	abstract = {Advances from immuno-oncology (IO) are changing the standard of care of many types of cancer, and the paradigm of cancer treatments and drug development is being rewritten on a regular basis. Moreover, an unprecedented number of new investigational agents and companies are entering the field of IO. As such, it has become challenging for oncology physicians conducting clinical trials, industry veterans developing IO drugs, and even regulators reviewing novel IO agents to keep track of the rapidly evolving landscape. To help the key stake holders in the field understand the latest IO landscape, we sought to present an unbiased, neutral, scientifically curated, and timely updated analysis of all the current IO agents in clinical development and the clinical trials testing these agents. We based our analyses on information collected from numerous trusted and publicly available sources. We have developed two databases. One database tracks 2004 IO agents (940 in clinical stage and 1064 in preclinical stage) against 303 targets, from 864 companies; the other tracks 3042 active clinical trials of these agents with a target enrollment of 577 076 patients. This report provides key analyses of these data. Furthermore, we will discuss a number of important and actionable trends in the current IO landscape: a large number of companies developing agents against the same IO targets; a rapid increase in the number of anti-PD-1/L1 combination studies, many of which are testing the same combinations and following inefficient patterns; and a significant increase in the number of small, investigator-initiated studies. For each of the findings, we speculate the causes and discuss a few initiatives that aim to address some of these challenges. Finally, by making these landscape analyses available, we aspire to inform the cancer community as they seek to strive for efficiencies and innovation while avoiding duplication.},

	abstract = {In addition to getting a preliminary assessment of efficacy, phase II trials can also help to determine dose(s) that have an acceptable toxicity profile over repeated cycles as well as identify subgroups with particularly poor toxicity profiles. Correct modeling of the dose-toxicity relationship in patients receiving multiple cycles of the same dose in oncology trials is crucial. A major challenge lies in taking advantage of the conditional nature of data collection, that is each cycle is observed conditional on having no previous toxicities on earlier cycles. We develop a novel and parsimonious model for the probability of toxicity during a kth cycle of therapy, conditional on not seeing toxicity in any of the k-1 previous cycles using a Markov model, hereafter we refer to these probabilities as conditional probabilities of toxicity. Our model allows the conditional probability of toxicity to depend on randomized dose group, cumulative dose from prior cycles, a measure of how consistently a patient responds to the same dose exposure and individual risk factors influencing the ability to tolerate the treatment regimen. Simulations studying finite sample properties of the model are given. Finally, the approach is demonstrated in a phase II trial studying two dose levels of ifosfamide plus doxorubicin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in soft tissue sarcoma patients over four cycles. The Markov model provides correct estimates of the probabilities of toxicity in finite sample simulations. It also correctly models the data from the phase II clinical trial, and identifies particularly high cumulative toxicity in females.},

We also collected information on the design of dose-finding clinical trials. Sponsors have used different MABEL approaches for FIH dose selection. To better assess acceptable approaches, FIH doses were computed from nonclinical studies and compared to the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) in patients, to the highest human doses (HHDs) when an MTD was not identified, or to the recommended human dose (RHD) for blinatumomab. We concluded that approaches based on receptor occupancy, highest non-severely toxic dose, or no-observed adverse effect level are not acceptable for selecting the FIH dose as they resulted in doses close to or above the MTDs, HHDs, or the RHD. A FIH dose corresponding to 10\%-30\% pharmacologic activity (PA) was an acceptable approach. A FIH dose corresponding to 50\% PA was acceptable for all except one construct, potentially due to its biological or structural properties. The most common toxicities in animals and patients were those related to cytokine release. Doses were better tolerated when intra-animal or intra-patient dose escalation was used. Exposing naïve patients to an MTD achieved with intra-patient dose escalation design may be unsafe.},

The information collected included pharmacology and toxicology data, FIH dose and rationale, and dose-finding trial design. We used the principles of the Hill equation to estimate the FIH doses for antibodies and compared them to the doses administered to patients with acceptable toxicities. For approximately half the antibodies (44\%) examined, the FIH doses were at least a hundred-fold lower than the doses safely administered to patients, indicating optimization of FIH dose selection and/or optimization of dose-finding trial design is needed to minimize patient exposure to sub-therapeutic doses. However, selection of the FIH dose for antibodies based on animal toxicology studies using 1/6th the HNSTD or 1/10th the NOAEL resulted in human doses that were unsafe for several antibodies examined. We also concluded that antibodies with Fc-modifications for increased effector function may be less tolerated, resulting in toxicities at lower doses than those without such modifications.

	abstract = {This paper studies the coherence conditions of dose-finding methods in the context of phase I clinical trials, where the objective is to estimate a targeted quantile of the unknown dose-toxicity curve. Most phase I methods are outcome-adaptive, and thus escalate or de-escalate doses for future patients based on the previous observations. An escalation for a new patient is said to be coherent only when the previous patient does not show sign of toxicity. Likewise, a de-escalation is coherent only when a toxic outcome has just been seen. The coherence conditions, motivated by ethical concerns in trial conduct, are satisfied by many statistical designs in the literature, but not by some commonly used modifications of the methods. This paper shows examples in which coherence is violated, and discusses how the coherence principles may be applied to calibrate a two-stage design and to deal with situations with delayed toxicity.},

Doses ranging from 10 to 1,000 mg/m2 were administered over 30 minutes weekly times 3 weeks every 4 weeks. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 790 mg/m2. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression, with thrombocytopenia and anemia quantitatively more important than granulocytopenia. Nonhematologic toxicity was minimal. Two responses in patients with adenocarcinomas of the colon and lung were documented. The maximum dFdC plasma concentration, reached after 15 minutes of infusion, was proportional to the total dose administered. Elimination, due mainly to deamination, was rapid (terminal half-life [t1/2], 8.0 minutes) and dose independent. The deamination product 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU) was eliminated with biphasic kinetics characterized by a long terminal phase (t1/2, 14 hours); it was the sole metabolite detected in urine. The concentration of dFdC 5'-triphosphate in circulating mononuclear cells increased in proportion to the dFdC dose at infusions between 35 and 250 mg/m2. No further increment in dFdC 5'-triphosphate (dFdCTP) was observed at higher doses, which resulted in plasma dFdC concentrations greater than 20 mumol/L (350 to 1,000 mg/m2), suggesting saturation of dFdC 5'-phosphate accumulation. The recommended dose for phase II clinical trials in solid tumors is 790 mg/m2/wk.},

The present article has focus on the design of a dose-finding study for pain in osteoarthritis patients treated with the TRPV1 antagonist AZD1386. We describe different design alternatives in the planning of this study, the reasoning for choosing the adaptive design and experiences with conduct and interim analysis. Three alternatives were proposed: one single dose-finding study with parallel design, a programme with a smaller Phase IIa study followed by a Phase IIb dose-finding study, and an adaptive dose-finding study. We describe these alternatives in detail and explain why the adaptive design was chosen for the study. We give insights in design aspects of the adaptive study, which need to be pre-planned, like interim decision criteria, statistical analysis method and setup of a Data Monitoring Committee. Based on the interim analysis it was recommended to stop the study for futility since AZD1386 showed no significant pain decrease based on the primary variable. We discuss results and experiences from the conduct of the study with the novel design approach. Huge cost savings have been done compared to if the option with one dose-finding design for Phase II had been chosen. However, we point out several challenges with this approach.},

A two center, dose escalation phase I study of rViscumin was carried out. Thirty-seven patients were included at 14 different dose-levels (10 to 6400 ng/kg). The complete clinical results are presented elsewhere. A 2-step CRM design enables one to speed-up the study and most importantly to obtain an accurate estimate of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Different management issues related to a multicenter study are illustrated and we show how the method can go wrong when severe toxicity, or dose limiting toxicity (DLT), is not considered by the clinician as being sufficient to limit dose escalation (here a grade 3 asthenia related to the drug). This would have affected any dose finding methods. We believe that CRM is a good alternative to the standard method from both a statistical and a practical point of view but further methodological research is necessary to address the issues related to the composite nature of the endpoint.},

	doi = {10.1200/JCO.2004.03.129},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to determine the maximum-tolerated dose of cisplatin that could be added to full-dose gemcitabine and radiation therapy (RT) in patients with pancreatic cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients were treated. Gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) was administered over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Cisplatin followed gemcitabine on days 1 and 15. The initial dose level of cisplatin was 30 mg/m(2), escalated to a targeted dose of 50 mg/m(2) using Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method. RT was initiated on cycle 1, day 1, in 2.4 Gy fractions to a total dose of 36 Gy. A second cycle of chemotherapy was planned following a 1-week rest.
RESULTS: Four of eight patients experienced acute dose limiting toxicity at the 50 mg/m(2) cisplatin dose level. Patients treated at 30 and 40 mg/m(2) cisplatin dose level tolerated therapy without dose-limiting toxicity. Median survival was 10.7 months (95\% CI, 5.4 to 18.2) for all patients, and 12.9 months (95\% CI, 7.4 to 21.2) for those without metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Cisplatin at doses up to 40 mg/m(2) may be safely added to full-dose gemcitabine and conformal RT. The Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method trial design allowed rapid completion of the study and confidence in the conclusion about the maximum tolerated dose, but accrued more patients to a dose level above the maximum tolerated dose than the typical phase I design.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The epothilones are a novel class of nontaxane microtubule-stabilizing agents. BMS-247550 is a semisynthetic analog of the natural product epothilone B. We conducted a phase I study administering BMS-247550 as a 1-hour intravenous infusion daily for 5 consecutive days every 21 days.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients received BMS-247550 without filgrastim in the first cycle. An additional six patients were enrolled at a starting dose of 8 mg/m2/d with filgrastim support. Twenty-one of the 27 patients had received prior paclitaxel, docetaxel, or both.
RESULTS: One hundred seven cycles were administered to 27 patients. The maximum-tolerated dose was 6 mg/m2 of BMS-247550 administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion daily for 5 consecutive days every 21 days. Dose-limiting toxicity at a dose of 8 mg/m2/d was neutropenia with or without filgrastim support. Nonhematologic grade 3 toxicities included fatigue (seven cycles), stomatitis (two cycles), and anorexia (one cycle). The mean terminal half-life of BMS-247550 was 16.8 +/- 6.0 hours, the volume of distribution at steady-state was 798 +/- 375 L, and the clearance was 712 +/- 247 mL/min. Objective responses were observed in patients with breast, cervical, and basal cell cancer. Reductions in CA-125 levels were noted in patients with ovarian cancer.
CONCLUSION: The recommended phase II dose of BMS-247550 on the daily schedule for 5 days is 6 mg/m2/d. Neutropenia was dose limiting, but higher doses were tolerated by a large fraction of patients with filgrastim support. Peripheral neuropathy was mild, even after multiple cycles of therapy, and was not dose limiting.},

	abstract = {Preclinical data suggest that some new anticancer agents directed at novel targets demonstrate tumor growth inhibition but not tumor shrinkage. Such cytostatic agents may offer clinical benefits for patients in the absence of tumor shrinkage. In addition, lower doses of some of these agents may be just as effective as higher doses, implying that toxicity may not be an ideal end point for dose finding. Because of these factors, the sequence and design of traditional phase I, II, and III trials used for cytotoxic agents (which typically shrink tumors and in a dose-dependent manner) may not be appropriate for cytostatic agents. This article discusses options for modifying trial designs to accommodate cytostatic agents. Examples are given where these options have been tried or are currently being tried. Recommendations given for choosing among the trial designs depend on what is known preclinically about the agents (eg, does one have a validated and reproducible biologic end point that can be used to guide a dose escalation?), what is known about the patient population being studied (eg, does one have a well-documented historical progression-free survival rate at 1 year for comparison with the experience of the new agent?), and the numbers of agents and patients available for participation in trials. Planned and ongoing trials will test the utility of some of these new approaches.},

NVB inhibits the polymerisation of tubulin and it has significant antitumor activity on P388 and L1210 leukemias and some other experimental tumors. In the present study, 20 patients (9 carcinomas, 10 lymphomas and 1 blastic crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia) received a median of 4 weekly i.v. doses of NVB. Two patients at least received each dose level: 3.6 mg/m2 (1/10 of the LD10 dose/kg in BDF1 mice), 7.2, 12, 18, 32.4, 35 and 43 mg/m2 per week. A total of 89 doses were administered. All patients had been first heavily pretreated and 17 of them had received a Vinca alkaloid. Leukopenia (neutropenia) was the dose-limiting toxicity. There was no thrombocytopenia. Leukopenia was dose-related and first seen at 32.4 mg/m2 per week. The maximal tolerated dose appears to be about 43 mg/m2. At that dose, 2 out of 3 patients developed severe leukopenia and neutropenia. One localized allergic reaction, one case of transient hepatic dysfunction, and 2 reversible peripheral neuropathies were seen. Pharmacokinetics, studied with a radioimmunoassay (RIA) method, suggested an elimination half-life of 30 h and a plasma clearance of 75 l/h. Four patients with Hodgkin's disease and two patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, all of them refractory to vincristine (VCR) and/or vinblastine (VBL), showed minor responses lasting 2-8 weeks. They had received between 4 and 12 doses of 30 and 43 mg/m2. We recommend for phase 11 trials the dose of 40 mg/m2 per week.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine a biweekly dose of oxaliplatin for combination with full-dose gemcitabine and concurrent radiation therapy (RT) in pancreatic cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with previously untreated pancreatic cancer received gemcitabine days 1, 8, and 15, and oxaliplatin days 1 and 15, repeated at 28-day intervals. RT (27 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions) was administered during cycle 1. Dose escalation was guided using the time-to-event continuous reassessment method. Dose levels 1 to 4 included gemcitabine 1 g/m2 intravenously (IV) during 30 minutes and oxaliplatin 40, 55, 70, or 85 mg/m2 IV during 90 minutes, respectively; for dose levels 5 and 6, oxaliplatin dose remained 85 mg/m2 but infusion time for gemcitabine 1 g/m2 was increased to 65 or 100 minutes, respectively. The trial objective was to determine the dose level associated with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) through cycle 2 in {\textless} or = 20\% of patients.
RESULTS: Forty-four patients were enrolled (median age, 64 years; 27 men, 17 women) with resectable (n = 12), unresectable (n = 29), and metastatic (n = 3) pancreatic cancer. Ten DLTs occurred in nine patients, including grade 4 platelets (n = 4), decline in performance status (n = 2), GI bleeding (n = 2), and GI toxicity (n = 2). The estimated probability of DLT for dose level 3 was .21 (90\% posterior probability interval [PI], .12 to .33); for dose level 4, the estimated probability was .24 (90\% PI, .14 to .36).
CONCLUSION: The addition of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 days 1 and 15 to full-dose gemcitabine and radiation therapy was well tolerated. On the basis of these results, a multi-institutional neoadjuvant phase II study in resectable pancreatic cancer is planned.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To shorten the study conduct timeline of pediatric phase I oncology trials by employing a novel trial design.
METHODS: A comparison of the traditional 3 + 3 patients per cohort, phase I trial design with a novel, rolling six design was performed by using discrete event simulation. The rolling six design allows for accrual of two to six patients concurrently onto a dose level based on the number of patients currently enrolled and evaluable, the number experiencing dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and the number still at risk of developing a DLT. Clinical trial simulations (n = 1,000) were based on historical data and were performed using SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Study timelines and patient numbers were determined for each design, and safety was assessed as a function of the number of DLTs observed.
RESULTS: In twelve completed historical studies, the median time to study completion was 452 days (range, 220 to 606 days); number of evaluable participants enrolled was 22 (range, 11 to 33), and DLTs occurring per study was three (range, 0 to 5). In 1,000 study simulations, in which the average time to new patient accrual was 10 days, the average +/- standard deviation (SD) time to study completion was 294 +/- 75 days for the rolling six design versus 350 +/- 84 days for the 3 + 3 design, whereas the number of DLTs per study was the same (average +/- SD, 3.3 +/- 1.1 v 3.2 +/- 1.1 for the rolling six and 3 + 3 designs, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The rolling six design may significantly decrease the duration of pediatric phase I studies without increasing the risk of toxicity. The design will be tested prospectively in upcoming Children's Oncology Group phase I trials.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To identify the optimal regimen and dosage of the oral mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus (RAD001).
METHODS: We performed a dose-escalation study in advanced cancer patients administering oral everolimus 5 to 30 mg/wk, with pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies. PD data prompted investigation of 50 and 70 mg weekly and daily dosing at 5 and 10 mg.
RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were treated. Dose-limiting toxicity was seen in one patient each at 50 mg/wk (stomatitis and fatigue) and 10 mg/d (hyperglycemia); hence, the maximum-tolerated dose was not reached. S6 kinase 1 activity in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells was inhibited for at least 7 days at doses {\textgreater}or= 20 mg/wk. Area under the curve increased proportional to dose, but maximum serum concentration increased less than proportionally at doses {\textgreater}or= 20 mg/wk. Terminal half-life was 30 hours (range, 26 to 38 hours). Partial responses were observed in four patients, and 12 patients remained progression free for {\textgreater}or= 6 months, including five of 10 patients with renal cell carcinoma.
CONCLUSION: Everolimus was satisfactorily tolerated at dosages up to 70 mg/wk and 10 mg/d with predictable PK. Antitumor activity and PD in tumors require further clinical investigation. Doses of 20 mg/wk and 5 mg/d are recommended as appropriate starting doses for these studies.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Everolimus is a selective mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor with promising anticancer activity. In order to identify a rationally based dose and schedule for cancer treatment, we have conducted a tumor pharmacodynamic phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients were treated with everolimus in cohorts of 20, 50, and 70 mg weekly or 5 and 10 mg daily. Dose escalation depended on dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate during the first 4-week period. Pre- and on-treatment steady-state tumor and skin biopsies were evaluated for total and phosphorylated (p) protein S6 kinase 1, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (elF-4E) binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF-4G), AKT, and Ki-67 expression. Plasma trough levels of everolimus were determined on a weekly basis before dosing during the first 4 weeks.
RESULTS: We observed a dose- and schedule-dependent inhibition of the mTOR pathway with a near complete inhibition of pS6 and peIF-4G at 10 mg/d and {\textgreater}or= 50 mg/wk. In addition, pAKT was upregulated in 50\% of the treated tumors. In the daily schedule, there was a correlation between everolimus plasma trough concentrations and inhibition of peIF4G and p4E-BP1. There was good concordance of mTOR pathway inhibition between skin and tumor. Clinical benefit was observed in four patients including one patient with advanced colorectal cancer achieving a partial response. DLTs occurred in five patients: one patient at 10 mg/d (grade 3 stomatitis) and four patients at 70 mg/wk (two with grade 3 stomatitis, one with grade 3 neutropenia, and one with grade 3 hyperglycemia).
CONCLUSION: Everolimus achieved mTOR signaling inhibition at doses below the DLT. A dosage of 10 mg/d or 50 mg/wk is recommended for further development.},

The comparisons of the three designs (CRM, EWOC, and the hybrid design) are presented by convergence rates and overdose proportions. The simulation results show that the hybrid design generally has faster convergence rates than EWOC and smaller overdose proportions than CRM, especially when the true maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is above the mid-level of the dose range considered. The performance of these three designs is also evaluated in terms of sensitivity to outliers.},

	abstract = {Temozolomide (CCRG 81045: M\&B 39831: NSC 362856) is an analogue of mitozolomide displaying similar broad spectrum activity in mouse tumours, but showing considerably less myelosuppression in the toxicology screen. Temozolomide was initially studied intravenously at doses between 50-200 mg m-2 and subsequently was given orally up to 1,200 mg m-2. A total of 51 patients were entered on the single dose schedule. Temozolomide exhibits linear pharmacokinetics with increasing dose. Myelotoxicity was dose limiting. Experimentally, temozolomide activity was schedule dependent and therefore oral administration was studied as a daily x 5 schedule between total doses of 750 and 1,200 mg m-2 in 42 patients. Myelosuppression was again dose limiting. The recommended dose for Phase II trials is 150 mg m-2 po for 5 days (total dose 750 mg m-2) for the first course, and if no major myelosuppression is detected on day 22 of the 4 week cycle, the subsequent courses can be given at 200 mg m-2 for 5 days (total dose 1 g m-2) on a 4 week cycle. Mild to moderate nausea and vomiting was dose related but readily controlled with antiemetics. Clinical activity was detected using the 5 day schedule in four (2CR, 2PR; 17\%) out of 23 patients with melanoma and in one patient with mycosis fungoides (CR lasting 7 months). Two patients with recurrent high grade gliomas have also had partial responses. Temozolomide is easy to use clinically and generally well tolerated. In the extended Phase I trial temozolomide only occasionally exhibited the unpredictable myelosuppression seen with mitozolomide.},

	abstract = {Clinical trial eligibility criteria are necessary to define the patient population under study and improve trial safety. However, there are concerns that eligibility criteria for cancer clinical trials are too restrictive and limit patient enrollment in clinical trials. Recently, there have been initiatives to re-examine and modernize eligibility criteria for oncology clinical trials. To assess current eligibility requirements for cancer clinical trials, we have conducted a comprehensive review of eligibility criteria for commercial investigational new drug clinical trial applications submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in 2015. Our findings suggest that eligibility criteria for current cancer clinical trials tend to narrowly define the study population and limit the study to lower-risk patients, which may not be reflective of the greater patient population outside of the study. We discuss potential areas for expanding eligibility criteria to include more patients in clinical trials and design options for clinical trials incorporating expanded eligibility criteria. The broadening of clinical trial eligibility criteria can be considered to better reflect the real-world patient population, improve clinical trial participation, and increase patient access to new investigational treatments.},

	abstract = {PurposePeople with HIV are living longer as a result of effective antiretroviral therapy. Cancer has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this patient population. However, studies of novel cancer therapeutics have historically excluded patients with HIV. Critical review of eligibility criteria related to HIV is required to accelerate development of and access to effective therapeutics for HIV-infected patients with cancer and make studies more generalizable to this patient population.MethodsFrom January through April 2016, the HIV Working Group conducted a series of teleconferences; a review of 46 New Drug Applications from registration studies of unique agents studied in adults with cancer that led to the initial US Food and Drug Administration approval of that agent from 2011 to 2015; and a review of HIV-related eligibility criteria from National Cancer Institute–sponsored studies. Results were discussed and refined at a multistakeholder workshop held May 12, 2016. The HIV Working Group developed recommendations for eligibility criteria that focus on pharmacologic and immunologic considerations in this patient population and that balance patient safety, access to appropriate investigational agents, and study integrity.ResultsExclusion of patients with HIV remains common in most studies of novel cancer agents. Models for HIV-related eligibility criteria in National Cancer Institute–sponsored studies are instructive. HIV infection itself should no longer be an exclusion criterion for most studies. Eligibility criteria related to HIV infection that address concurrent antiretroviral therapy and immune status should be designed in a manner that is appropriate for a given cancer.ConclusionExpanding clinical trial eligibility to be more inclusive of patients with HIV is justified in most cases and may accelerate the development of effective therapies in this area of unmet clinical need.},

Excessive or overly restrictive eligibility criteria can slow trial accrual, jeopardize the generalizability of results, and limit understanding of the intervention’s benefit-risk profile.MethodsASCO, Friends of Cancer Research, and the US Food and Drug Administration examined specific eligibility criteria (ie, brain metastases, minimum age, HIV infection, and organ dysfunction and prior and concurrent malignancies) to determine whether to modify definitions to extend trials to a broader population. Working groups developed consensus recommendations based on review of evidence, consideration of the patient population, and consultation with the research community.ResultsPatients with treated or clinically stable brain metastases should be routinely included in trials and only excluded if there is compelling rationale. In initial dose-finding trials, pediatric-specific cohorts should be included based on strong scientific rationale for benefit. Later phase trials in diseases that span adult and pediatric populations should include patients older than age 12 years. HIV-infected patients who are healthy and have low risk of AIDS-related outcomes should be included absent specific rationale for exclusion. Renal function criteria should enable liberal creatinine clearance, unless the investigational agent involves renal excretion. Patients with prior or concurrent malignancies should be included, especially when the risk of the malignancy interfering with either safety or efficacy endpoints is very low.ConclusionTo maximize generalizability of results, trial enrollment criteria should strive for inclusiveness.

	abstract = {PurposeBroadening trial eligibility to improve accrual and access and to better reflect intended-to-treat populations has been recognized as a priority. Historically, patients with brain metastases have been understudied, because of restrictive eligibility across all phases of clinical trials.MethodsIn 2016, after a literature search and series of teleconferences, a multistakeholder workshop was convened. Our working group focused on developing consensus recommendations regarding the inclusion of patients with brain metastases in clinical trials, as part of a broader effort that encompassed minimum age, HIV status, and organ dysfunction. The working group attempted to balance the needs of protecting patient safety, facilitating access to investigational therapies, and ensuring trial integrity. On the basis of input at the workshop, guidelines were further refined and finalized.ResultsThe working group identified three key populations: those with treated/stable brain metastases, defined as patients who have received prior therapy for their brain metastases and whose CNS disease is radiographically stable at study entry; those with active brain metastases, defined as new and/or progressive brain metastases at the time of study entry; and those with leptomeningeal disease. In most circumstances, the working group encourages the inclusion of patients with treated/stable brain metastases in clinical trials. A framework of key considerations for patients with active brain metastases was developed. For patients with leptomeningeal disease, inclusion of a separate cohort in both early-phase and later-phase trials is recommended, if CNS activity is anticipated and when relevant to the specific disease type.ConclusionExpanding eligibility to be more inclusive of patients with brain metastasis is justified in many cases and may speed the development of effective therapies in this area of high clinical need.},

Inclusion of patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction may be possible when the totality of the available nonclinical and clinical data indicates that inclusion is safe. Ejection fraction values should be used with investigator assessment of a patient’s risk for heart failure to determine eligibility. Patients with laboratory parameters out of normal range as a result of hematologic disease should be included in trials.

We evaluated the historical context, published literature, regulatory considerations, and myriad risks and benefits associated with lowering the age of enrollment on oncology clinical trials.ResultsWe conclude that many of the historical concerns about including children early in oncology clinical trials do not apply in the current scientific and clinical environment of pediatric oncology and drug development; we provide specific recommendations for how the inclusion of children in early-phase investigational cancer drug trials might be accomplished. Automatic inclusion of pediatric patients is appropriate in early-phase trials that assess dose, safety, and pharmacokinetics in a variety of tumor types and later phase trials that assess efficacy in a specific disease that spans adult and pediatric populations.ConclusionIncluding children in appropriately designed adult clinical oncology trials is feasible and can be done in a way that enhances their access to these agents without compromising safety or development strategies.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To purpose of this study was to develop a more effective approach to the treatment of patients with poor-prognosis aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty newly diagnosed patients with bulky ({\textgreater} or = 10 cm) advanced-stage aggressive NHL were enrolled onto a pilot study. The study was designed to determine the maximum-tolerated dosages (MTD) of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin that could be used in a high-dose cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) regimen with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support and to assess preliminarily the efficacy of the regimen.
RESULTS: In the initial dose-finding portion of the study, cumulative thrombocytopenia was the dose-limiting toxicity. At the MTD, the regimen included four 21-day cycles of cyclophosphamide 4 gm/m2, doxorubicin 70 mg/m2, vincristine 2 mg, and prednisone 100 mg for 5 days with mesna and G-CSF support. At the MTD, 65\% of treatment cycles were complicated by febrile neutropenia, 84\% of patients received at least one platelet transfusion for platelet counts less than 20,000/microL, and there was one treatment-related death. Nineteen of 22 (86\%; 90\% confidence interval [CI], 68 to 96) patients treated at the MTD achieved an initial complete response (CR), and 79\% (90\% CI, 58 to 92) of the complete responders and 69\% of all patients remain progression-free with 20 months median follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The high-dose CHOP regimen may be an effective alternative for patients with poor-prognosis aggressive NHL.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immunochemotherapy with rituximab and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) has become the standard of care for elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We aimed to ascertain if a dose-dense R-CHOP regimen administered every 2 weeks (R-CHOP14) was superior to the standard 3-week schedule (R-CHOP21).
METHODS: We did a randomised phase 3 trial at 83 centres in four countries. 602 patients aged 60-80 years with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and at least one adverse prognostic factor (age-adjusted international prognostic index ≥ 1) were eligible for the study. We randomly allocated individuals to R-CHOP-ie, rituximab (375 mg/m(2)), cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m(2)), doxorubicin (50 mg/m(2)), vincristine (1.4 mg/m(2), up to 2 mg) all on day 1, and prednisone 40 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days-administered every 14 days (n=304) or every 21 days (n=298) for eight cycles. We did permuted-block randomisation (block size four, allocation ratio 1:1) stratified by centre and number of adverse prognostic factors. The primary endpoint was event-free survival. Our analysis was of the intention-to-treat population, and we present the final analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00144755.
FINDINGS: Two patients allocated R-CHOP21 were ineligible for the study and were excluded from analyses. After median follow-up of 56 months (IQR 27-60), 3-year event-free survival was 56\% (95\% CI 50-62) in the R-CHOP14 group and 60\% (55-66) in the R-CHOP21 group (hazard ratio 1.04, 95\% CI 0.82-1.31; p=0.7614). Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 224 (74\%) of 304 patients allocated R-CHOP14 and 189 (64\%) of 296 assigned R-CHOP21, despite increased use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in the R-CHOP14 group compared with the R-CHOP21 group. 143 (47\%) patients in the R-CHOP14 group received at least one red-blood-cell transfusion versus 93 (31\%) in the R-CHOP21 group (p=0.0001). 35 (12\%) patients allocated R-CHOP14 received at least one platelet transfusion versus 25 (8\%) assigned R-CHOP21 (p=0.2156). 155 (51\%) patients who were assigned R-CHOP14 had at least one serious adverse event compared with 140 (47\%) who were allocated R-CHOP21.
INTERPRETATION: In elderly patients with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and at least one adverse prognostic factor, a 2-week dose-dense R-CHOP regimen did not improve efficacy compared with the 3-week standard schedule. The frequency of toxic side-effects was similar between regimens, but R-CHOP14 was associated with increased need for red-blood-cell transfusion.

	abstract = {7021Background: Clinical trials of experimental drugs require controls. Concurrently randomized controls are the gold standard for judging drug effect. Historical controls are not ideal but are much more efficient and economical. Historical controls derived from a single clinical trial have the biases of that trial. Using many trials with comparable end points and eligibility minimizes such bias. Medidata’s archive contains {\textgreater}3000 trials with clinical data rights for deidentified aggregated analyses. We used this resource to develop a synthetic control arm (SCA) for a particular phase I/II single-arm trial in AML. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by addressing a different but equally important issue: establishing early end points as predictors of long term clinical outcomes. Methods: We built an SCA from 7 relapsed/refractory AML trials completed in last 5 yrs. They had similar eligibility criteria as a particular phase I/II trial for an investigational agent. We selected subjects for the SCA who had baseline covariates matching the subjects in the tri.al. Data cleaning and standardization ensured consistency of data fields. The primary outcomes were CR (complete remission) and CRi (CR without hematologic recovery) at 56 days, and overall survival (OS) subsequent to 56 days. Non-CR/non-CRi deaths before 56 days were set to OS=0. We used a landmark analysis to correlate CR and CRi with OS, calculating the hazard ratio (HR) of OS of CR and CRi vs its comparison group. Results: The SCA included 340 subjects (median age 63 yrs, 55\% male, 77\% White Non-Hispanic, 28\% ECOG 0). Results are in this table. Conclusions: The Medidata trial archive is a resource for creating SCAs. The example SCA we created identified well-defined subjects for whom a CR or CRi is associated with longer OS. Investigations of SCAs for other drugs could aid in addressing the types of subjects and drug categories for which CR or CR/CRi predict longer OS. Such information can help build more efficient and more informative adaptive clinical trials.

We compared R-CHOP-14 with the same regimen combined with 4 extra R administrations during the first 4 cycles. Patients in complete remission after induction treatment were randomized between observation and R maintenance. Here we report the efficacy results of the first randomization. Methods: Patients with DLBCL, stage II-IV, were randomized between R-CHOP-14 and an experimental arm with R-CHOP-14 combined with extra R 375 mg/m2 IV on day 8 of the first 4 cycles. Response was evaluated using PET-CT scans (Lugano criteria 2014). A Deauville score of ≤ 3 was considered as a complete response. The primary endpoint was metabolic complete remission rate after induction treatment. (www.trialregister.nlNTR1014). Results: 575 patients were randomized (standard arm 286 patients, experimental arm 289 patients). Median age was 65 years (range, 18-80), 50\% of patients were 66 years or older and 52\% were male. The majority of patients (57\%) had a high-intermediate or high aa-IPI score. Baseline patient and disease characteristics were well balanced between treatment arms. No significant difference in CR rate was observed between the two treatment arms, standard arm 84\% CR and experimental arm 82\% CR (odds ratio = 0.83, 95\% CI 0.54-1.28, p=0.40). The observed CR rates in patients ≤ or {\textgreater} 65 years were identical. With a median follow-up of 49 months (maximum 90 months), 3- and 5- year progression free survival (PFS) were 74\% and 68\% in the standard arm and 71\% and 61\% in the experimental arm (hazard ratio = 1.23, 95\% CI 0.92-1.63, p=0.16). No significant improvement in PFS was noted in subgroups by age (≤ or {\textgreater} 65 years) or gender. Toxicity data will be available at ASCO. Conclusions: In patients with DLBCL treated with R-CHOP-14 rituximab intensification early during treatment did not improve the CR rate or the 3-year PFS. No clinical subgroup benefited from rituximab intensification. Clinical trial information: NTR1014.},

	abstract = {To determine the effect of gender on outcome, the male hazard ratio for progression-free survival (HRPFS-male) was determined in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In young patients (MapThera International Trial study), HRPFS-male was 1.3 (P = .092) without and 1.1 (P = .660) with rituximab. In elderly patients (RICOVER-60 study), HRPFS-male was 1.1 (P = .348) with CHOP but increased to 1.6 (P = .004) with R-CHOP. The similar improvements of outcome in young patients were associated with similar rituximab clearances in young males and females (9.89 vs 10.38 mL/h; P = .238), whereas the greater benefit for elderly females was associated with a slower rituximab clearance (8.47 vs 10.59 mL/h; P = .005) and hence higher serum levels and longer exposure times, attributable to an age-dependent (P = .004) decrease of rituximab clearance in females but not males. Compared with elderly females, all other subgroups had significantly faster rituximab clearances and hence appear to be suboptimally dosed when rituximab is given at 375 mg/m(2). Although early results of pharmacokinetic-based prospective trials designed to exploit the full therapeutic potential of rituximab suggest that increased doses and/or prolonged exposure times can improve the outcome of elderly males with DLBCL, further studies are warranted that address the optimization of rituximab dose and schedule in all subgroups of DLBCL patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The efficacy of autologous stem-cell transplantation during the first remission in patients with diffuse, aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma classified as high-intermediate risk or high risk on the International Prognostic Index remains controversial and is untested in the rituximab era.
METHODS: We treated 397 patients who had disease with an age-adjusted classification of high risk or high-intermediate risk with five cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) or CHOP plus rituximab. Patients with a response were randomly assigned to receive three additional cycles of induction chemotherapy (control group) or one additional cycle of induction chemotherapy followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation (transplantation group). The primary efficacy end points were 2-year progression-free survival and overall survival.
RESULTS: Of 370 induction-eligible patients, 253 were randomly assigned to the transplantation group (125) or the control group (128). Forty-six patients in the transplantation group and 68 in the control group had disease progression or died, with 2-year progression-free survival rates of 69 and 55\%, respectively (hazard ratio in the control group vs. the transplantation group, 1.72; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.18 to 2.51; P=0.005). Thirty-seven patients in the transplantation group and 47 in the control group died, with 2-year overall survival rates of 74 and 71\%, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.26; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 1.94; P=0.30). Exploratory analyses showed a differential treatment effect according to risk level for both progression-free survival (P=0.04 for interaction) and overall survival (P=0.01 for interaction). Among high-risk patients, the 2-year overall survival rate was 82\% in the transplantation group and 64\% in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Early autologous stem-cell transplantation improved progression-free survival among patients with high-intermediate-risk or high-risk disease who had a response to induction therapy. Overall survival after transplantation was not improved, probably because of the effectiveness of salvage transplantation.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dose intensification with a combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) every 2 weeks improves outcomes in patients older than 60 years with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma compared with CHOP every 3 weeks. We investigated whether this survival benefit from dose intensification persists in the presence of rituximab (R-CHOP) in all age groups.
METHODS: Patients (aged ≥18 years) with previously untreated bulky stage IA to stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in 119 centres in the UK were randomly assigned centrally in a one-to-one ratio, using minimisation, to receive six cycles of R-CHOP every 14 days plus two cycles of rituximab (R-CHOP-14) or eight cycles of R-CHOP every 21 days (R-CHOP-21). R-CHOP-21 was intravenous cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m(2), doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2), vincristine 1·4 mg/m(2) (maximum dose 2 mg), and rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 1, and oral prednisolone 40 mg/m(2) on days 1-5, administered every 21 days for a total of eight cycles. R-CHOP-14 was intravenous cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m(2), doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2), vincristine 2 mg, rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 1, and oral prednisolone 100 mg on days 1-5, administered every 14 days for six cycles, followed by two further infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 14 days. The trial was not masked. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). This study is registered, number ISRCTN 16017947.
FINDINGS: 1080 patients were assigned to R-CHOP-21 (n=540) and R-CHOP-14 (n=540). With a median follow-up of 46 months (IQR 35-57), 2-year OS was 82·7\% (79·5-85·9) in the R-CHOP-14 group and 80·8\% (77·5-84·2) in the R-CHOP-21 (standard) group (hazard ratio 0·90, 95\% CI 0·70-1·15; p=0·3763). No significant improvement was noted in 2-year progression-free survival (R-CHOP-14 75·4\%, 71·8-79·1, and R-CHOP-21 74·8\%, 71·0-78·4; 0·94, 0·76-1·17; p=0·5907). High international prognostic index, poor-prognosis molecular characteristics, and cell of origin were not predictive for benefit from either schedule. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was higher in the R-CHOP-21 group (318 [60\%] of 534 vs 167 [31\%] of 534), with no prophylactic use of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor mandated in this group, whereas grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was higher with R-CHOP-14 (50 [9\%] vs 28 [5\%]); other frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events were febrile neutropenia (58 [11\%] vs 28 [5\%]) and infection (125 [23\%] vs 96 [18\%]). Frequencies of non-haematological adverse events were similar in the R-CHOP-21 and R-CHOP-14 groups.
INTERPRETATION: R-CHOP-14 is not superior to R-CHOP-21 chemotherapy for previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; therefore, R-CHOP-21 remains the standard first-line treatment in patients with this haematological malignancy. No molecular or clinical subgroup benefited from dose intensification in this study.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the impact of neutropenia or leukopenia experienced during chemotherapy on survival.
METHODS: Eligible studies included prospective or retrospective analyses that evaluated neutropenia or leukopenia as a prognostic factor for overall survival or disease-free survival. Statistical analyses were conducted to calculate a summary hazard ratio and 95\% confidence interval (CI) using random-effects or fixed-effects models based on the heterogeneity of the included studies.
RESULTS: Thirteen trials were selected for the meta-analysis, with a total of 9,528 patients. The hazard ratio of death was 0.69 (95\% CI, 0.64-0.75) for patients with higher-grade neutropenia or leukopenia compared to patients with lower-grade or lack of cytopenia. Our analysis was also stratified by statistical method (any statistical method to decrease lead-time bias; time-varying analysis or landmark analysis), but no differences were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that neutropenia or leukopenia experienced during chemotherapy is associated with improved survival in patients with advanced cancer or hematological malignancies undergoing chemotherapy. Future prospective analyses designed to investigate the potential impact of chemotherapy dose adjustment coupled with monitoring of neutropenia or leukopenia on survival are warranted.},

METHODS: A total of 387 chemotherapy-naïve patients who received chemotherapy (vinorelbine and gemcitabine followed by docetaxel, or paclitaxel and carboplatin) in a randomised controlled trial were evaluated. The proportional-hazards regression model was used to examine the effects of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and tumour response on overall survival. Landmark analysis was used to lessen the bias of more severe neutropenia resulting from more treatment cycles allowed by longer survival, whereby patients who died within 126 days of starting chemotherapy were excluded.
RESULTS: The adjusted hazard ratios for patients with grade-1 to 2 neutropenia or grade-3 to 4 neutropenia compared with no neutropenia were 0.59 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.36-0.97) and 0.71 (95\% CI, 0.49-1.03), respectively. The hazard ratios did not differ significantly between the patients who developed neutropenia with stable disease (SD), and those who lacked neutropenia with partial response (PR).
CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is a predictor of better survival for patients with advanced NSCLC. Prospective randomised trials of early-dose increases guided by chemotherapy-induced toxicities are warranted.},

Chemical-based toxicity is defined as toxicity that is related to the physicochemical characteristics of a compound and its effects on cellular organelles, membranes, and/or metabolic pathways. On-target refers to exaggerated and adverse pharmacologic effects at the target of interest in the test system. Off-target refers to adverse effects as a result of modulation of other targets; these may be related biologically or totally unrelated to the target of interest. Both the risk assessment and development strategies used for xenobiotics are influenced by the understanding of the mechanism of toxicity. It is imperative that the toxicologic pathologist use the toxicologic and biologic data at hand and literature information on the target to form testable hypotheses related to whether a toxicity is chemical-based, on-target, or off-target. The objective of this session at the 2012 Society of Toxicologic Pathologists Symposium in Boston, Massachusetts, was to discuss chemical-based, on-target, and off-target-based effects and the scientific approaches used to aid in their human risk assessment.},

The authors prospectively studied MPA pharmacokinetics and IMPDH inhibition in 28 pediatric de novo kidney transplant recipients. Pretransplant IMPDH activity and full PK/PD profiles were obtained at 3 different occasions: 1 to 3 days, 4 to 9 days, and approximately 6 months after transplant. Large intra- and interpatient variability was noted in MPA pharmacokinetics and exposure and IMPDH inhibition. MPA exposure (AUC(0-12 h)) was low early posttransplant and increased over time and stabilized at months 3 to 6. Mean pretransplant IMPDH activity (6.4 ± 4.6 nmol/h/mg protein) was lower than previously reported in adults. In most of the patients, IMPDH enzyme activity decreased with increasing MPA plasma concentration, with maximum inhibition coinciding with maximum MPA concentration. The overall relationship between MPA concentration and IMPDH activity was described by a direct inhibitory E(max) model (EC(50) = 0.97 mg/L). This study suggests the importance of early PK/PD monitoring to improve drug exposure. Because IMPDH inhibition is well correlated to MPA concentration, pretransplant IMPDH activity may serve as an early marker to guide the initial level of MPA exposure required in a pediatric population.},

The key involvement of angiogenesis in tumor growth and metastasis has started to redefine chemotherapy and new protocols have emerged. Metronomic chemotherapy, which is intended to prevent tumor angiogenesis, is based on more frequent and low-dose drug administrations compared with conventional chemotherapy. The potential of metronomic chemotherapy was revealed in animal models a decade ago and the efficacy of this approach has been confirmed in the clinic. In the past 5 years, multiple clinical trials have investigated the safety and efficacy of metronomic chemotherapy in a variety of human cancers. While the results have been variable, clinical studies have shown that these new treatment protocols represent an interesting alternative for either primary systemic therapy or maintenance therapy. We review the latest clinical trials of metronomic chemotherapy in adult and pediatric cancer patients. Accumulating evidence suggests that the efficacy of such treatment may not only rely on anti-angiogenic activity. Potential new mechanisms of action, such as restoration of anticancer immune response and induction of tumor dormancy are discussed. Finally, we highlight the research efforts that need to be made to facilitate the optimal development of metronomic chemotherapy.},

The expected net present value was used to quantify the financial implications of different strategies.We found that adaptive dose allocation approaches (in particular, the Bayesian general adaptive dose allocation method) usually outperformed other fixed dose allocation approaches with respect to both probability of success and dose selection. Design-adaptive approaches were more efficient than analysis-adaptive approaches. The allocation of additional resources into phase II improved the probability of success in phase III and the expected net present value. Bringing two doses forward into phase III testing also increased the probability of success and improved the expected net present value. The overall probability of success in phase III ranged from 35\% to 65\%, consistent with recent industry experience. This success rate could likely be improved with additional investment in phase II, the use of design-adaptive dose-finding designs when possible, increasing the power of phase III trials, more explicit consideration of toxicity concerns, and better dose selection.},

We aimed to compare endoscopic and clinical outcomes in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who were managed with a tight control algorithm, using clinical symptoms and biomarkers, versus patients managed with a clinical management algorithm.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}CALM was an open-label, randomised, controlled phase 3 study, done in 22 countries at 74 hospitals and outpatient centres, which evaluated adult patients (aged 18–75 years) with active endoscopic Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity [CDEIS] {\textgreater}6; sum of CDEIS subscores of {\textgreater}6 in one or more segments with ulcers), a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of 150–450 depending on dose of prednisone at baseline, and no previous use of immunomodulators or biologics. Patients were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to tight control or clinical management groups, stratified by smoking status (yes or no), weight ({\textless}70 kg or ≥70 kg), and disease duration (≤2 years or {\textgreater}2 years) after 8 weeks of prednisone induction therapy, or earlier if they had active disease. In both groups, treatment was escalated in a stepwise manner, from no treatment, to adalimumab induction followed by adalimumab every other week, adalimumab every week, and lastly to both weekly adalimumab and daily azathioprine. This escalation was based on meeting treatment failure criteria, which differed between groups (tight control group before and after random assignment: faecal calprotectin ≥250 μg/g, C-reactive protein ≥5mg/L, CDAI ≥150, or prednisone use in the previous week; clinical management group before random assignment: CDAI decrease of {\textless}70 points compared with baseline or CDAI {\textgreater}200; clinical management group after random assignment: CDAI decrease of {\textless}100 points compared with baseline or CDAI ≥200, or prednisone use in the previous week). De-escalation was possible for patients receiving weekly adalimumab and azathioprine or weekly adalimumab alone if failure criteria were not met. The primary endpoint was mucosal healing (CDEIS {\textless}4) with absence of deep ulcers 48 weeks after randomisation. Primary and safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.

A significantly higher proportion of patients in the tight control group achieved the primary endpoint at week 48 (56 [46\%] of 122 patients) than in the clinical management group (37 [30\%] of 122 patients), with a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test-adjusted risk difference of 16·1\% (95\% CI 3·9–28·3; p=0·010). 105 (86\%) of 122 patients in the tight control group and 100 (82\%) of 122 patients in the clinical management group reported treatment-emergent adverse events; no treatment-related deaths occurred. The most common adverse events were nausea (21 [17\%] of 122 patients), nasopharyngitis (18 [15\%]), and headache (18 [15\%]) in the tight control group, and worsening Crohn's disease (35 [29\%] of 122 patients), arthralgia (19 [16\%]), and nasopharyngitis (18 [15\%]) in the clinical management group.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}CALM is the first study to show that timely escalation with an anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy on the basis of clinical symptoms combined with biomarkers in patients with early Crohn's disease results in better clinical and endoscopic outcomes than symptom-driven decisions alone.

	abstract = {BackgroundProgrammed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) blockade therapies have demonstrated durable responses and prolonged survival in a variety of malignancies. Treatment is generally well tolerated although immune-related adverse events (irAEs) can occur. Autoimmune thyroid dysfunction is among the most common irAE, but an assessment of the clinical, mechanistic, and immunologic features has not been previously described.Patient and methodsPatients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with pembrolizumab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (n = 51) as part of KEYNOTE-001 (NCT01295827) were included. Thyroid function test and anti-thyroid antibodies were assessed prospectively at each study visit, beginning before the first treatment. Frequency of development of thyroid dysfunction, association with anti-thyroid antibodies, clinical course, and relationship with progression-free survival and overall survival to treatment with pembrolizumab was evaluated.ResultsOf 51 patients treated, 3 were hypothyroid and 48 were not at baseline. Ten of 48 [21\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 10\% to 35\%] patients developed thyroid dysfunction requiring thyroid replacement. Anti-thyroid antibodies were present in 8 of 10 patients who developed thyroid dysfunction, compared with 3 of 38 who did not (80\% versus 8\%, P \&lt; 0.0001). Thyroid dysfunction occurred early (median, 42 days) in the pembrolizumab course, and a majority (6 of 10 patients) experienced brief, transient hyperthyroidism preceding the onset of hypothyroidism; no persistent hyperthyroidism occurred. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism were largely asymptomatic. Overall survival with pembrolizumab was significantly longer in subjects who developed thyroid dysfunction (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95\% CI 0.09–0.94; P = 0.04).ConclusionsThyroid dysfunction during pembrolizumab treatment of NSCLC is common and is characterized by early-onset, frequently preceded by transient hyperthyroidism, closely associated with anti-thyroid antibodies, and may be associated with improved outcomes. The presence of antibody-mediated toxicity in T-cell-directed therapy suggests an under-recognized impact of PD-1 biology in modulating humoral immunity.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: OSI-906 is a potent inhibitor of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) and insulin receptor (IR). The purpose of this study was to determine the MTD, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary activity of OSI-906 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a nonrandomized, open-label, phase I, dose-escalation study in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study also included a diabetic expansion cohort and a biomarker expansion cohort of patients with colorectal cancer. Patients were treated with OSI-906 by once- or twice-daily continuous dosing schedules.
RESULTS: Of 95 patients enrolled in the study, 86 received at least one dose of OSI-906. Dose-limiting toxicities included QTc prolongation, grade 2 abdominal pain and nausea, hyperglycemia, and elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (all grade 3). The MTDs were established to be 400 mg once daily and 150 mg twice daily. The recommended phase II dose was determined as 150 mg twice daily. OSI-906 was rapidly absorbed with a half-life of 5 hours, and steady-state plasma concentrations were achieved by day 8. Pharmacodynamic effects on IGF1R and IR phosphorylation were levels observed and correlated with plasma concentrations of OSI-906. Thirty-one patients had stable disease as their best response. One patient with melanoma had a radiographic partial response and underwent resection, during which only melanocytic debris but no viable tumor tissue was identified.
CONCLUSIONS: At the established MTD, OSI-906 was well tolerated and antitumor activity was observed. These results support further evaluation of OSI-906 in solid tumors.},

	abstract = {Clinical investigators in oncology are increasingly interested in using molecular analysis of cancer tissue to understand the biologic bases of response or resistance to novel interventions and to develop prognostic and predictive biomarkers that will guide clinical decision making. Some scientific questions of this nature can only be addressed, or may best be addressed, through the conduct of a clinical trial in which research biopsies are obtained from all participants. However, trial designs with mandatory research biopsies have raised ethical concerns related to the risk of harm to participants, the adequacy of voluntary informed consent, and the potential for misunderstanding among research participants when access to an experimental intervention is linked to the requirement to undergo a research biopsy. In consideration of the ethical and scientific issues at stake in this debate, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B Ethics Committee proposes guidelines for clinical trials involving mandatory research biopsies. Any cancer clinical trial that requires research biopsies of participants must be well designed to address the scientific question, obtain the biopsy in a way that minimizes risk, and ensure that research participants are fully informed of the risks, rationale, and requirements of the study, as well as of treatment alternatives. Further guidelines and discussions of this issue are specified in this position paper. We feel that if these principles are respected, an informed adult with cancer can both understand and voluntarily consent to participation in a clinical trial involving mandatory research biopsy for scientific end points.},

	abstract = {Although there is an extensive statistical literature showing the disadvantages of discretizing continuous variables, categorization is a common practice in clinical research which results in substantial loss of information. A large collection of methods in cancer phase I clinical trial design establishes dose of a new agent as a discrete variable. A noteworthy exception is the Escalation With Overdose Control (EWOC) design, where doses can be defined either as continuous or as a grid of discrete doses. A Monte Carlo simulation study was performed to compare the operating characteristics of continuous and discrete dose EWOC designs. Four equally spaced grids with different interval lengths were considered. The loss of information was measured by several operating characteristics easier for clinicians to interpret, in addition to the usual statistical measures of bias and mean squared error. Based on the simulations, if there is not enough knowledge about the true MTD value as commonly happens in phase I clinical trials, continuous dose scheme arises as an attractive option.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence and type of rheumatic immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), as well as the correlation with tumour response.
METHODS: This was a single-centre prospective observational study including all cancer patients receiving ICIs. The occurrence of irAEs and tumour response was assessed on a regular basis. Patients who experienced musculoskeletal symptoms were referred to the department of rheumatology for clinical evaluation and management.
RESULTS: From September 2015 to May 2017, 524 patients received ICIs and 35 were referred to the department of rheumatology (6.6\%). All but one of the rheumatic irAEs occurred with anti-programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1)/PD-1 ligand 1(PD-L1) antibodies, with a median exposure time of 70 days. There were two distinct clinical presentations: (1) inflammatory arthritis (3.8\%) mimicking either rheumatoid arthritis (n=7), polymyalgia rheumatica (n=11) or psoriatic arthritis (n=2) and (2) non-inflammatory musculoskeletal conditions (2.8\%; n=15). One patient with rheumatoid arthritis was anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) positive. Nineteen patients required glucocorticoids, and methotrexate was started in two patients. Non-inflammatory disorders were managed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics and/or physiotherapy. ICI treatment was pursued in all but one patient. Patients with rheumatic irAEs had a higher tumour response rate compared with patients without irAEs (85.7\% vs 35.3\%; P{\textless}0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Since ICIs are used with increasing frequency, knowledge of rheumatic irAEs and their management is of major interest. All patients were responsive either to low-to-moderate doses of prednisone or symptomatic therapies and did not require ICI discontinuation. Furthermore, tumour response was significantly higher in patients who experienced rheumatic irAEs.},

RECENT FINDINGS: In the last few years, there has been a debate on different models of integration of palliative care in oncology, on early palliative care, supportive care, supportive and palliative care, continuous care, end-of life care and pain management in the trajectory of cancer.
SUMMARY: The aims of the SCCU of the NCI of Milan are mainly four: to collaborate with the individual specialists of NCI through integrated and ancillary activities while implementing a supportive therapy to treat the side effects, toxicities of oncological therapies, and comorbidities in the patients from the time of diagnosis and throughout the oncology treatment period; to assess all patients' needs through Italian validated versions of assessment tools, in order to ensure early care of the patient in a holistic approach; to support family members, survivors and healthcare professionals; and to promote research (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) and educational programs.Our integrated model of medicine in oncology, which we define 'supportive care', is part of the clinical history of the patients, from the time of diagnosis and during oncological treatments, to facilitate their psychological well being and improve adherence to treatment protocols.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The French speaking association for supportive care in cancer (AFSOS) conducted an observational study to evaluate practices, organisations and information given to patients. A specific 32 point questionnaire was sent to 1621 French physicians (MDs) caring for cancer patients.
RESULTS: Three different organisations were evaluated: the individual MDs, the transversal team and its particular structure specialised in global patient care specifically developed at comprehensive cancer centres - CCC. During their disease, 68\% of patients received SCC, which was more available during the palliative period (90\%) than at the diagnosis (44\%). Our results found that 71\% of cancer departments had a specific interdisciplinary cross-team to provide SCC, particularly in CCC (62\%; p=0.01) while 37\% had specific inpatient units. A specific organisation dedicated to home care was greater in CCC than in public or private centres (69\%, 45\%, 20\% respectively; p=0.01). Adverse event information was performed more by an oncologist than other specialists (p=0.01).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the specific SCC organisation could be a useful management tool to improve supportive care for cancer patients.},

In this paper, we build on the premise that the task of early-phase testing is to optimize various components of a potential therapy so that later, confirmatory trials have the maximal probability of informing drug development and clinical care. We then explore three strategies that investigators might use to manage trial risks while optimizing a therapy, using cell therapy for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) as an example. We argue that an iterative application of maximin strategies over successive cohorts and trials, which we call the “risk-escalation model,” establishes a moral principle that should guide decision-making in early-phase trials.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Supportive care in oncology is a primary need for every oncology department nowadays. In 2012, in our institution, a dedicated supportive care service (SCS) was created in order to deal with any need our on-treatment patients might have (e.g. tumour-related or treatment-related symptoms). We hypothesized that this service had a positive impact on the number of unplanned hospitalizations; to confirm our hypothesis, we decided to review admission data in 2011 and 2012.
METHODS: Using our internal software, we compared admission data in 2011 (that is, the year before the dedicated service was created) and 2012 (when such service began, that is April of that year). We also made an evaluation of the costs of these hospitalizations.
RESULTS: Despite an increase of the number of patients treated in our day hospital (+6.5 \%), the number of unplanned hospital admissions decreased by 3.2 \% (from 17.3 to 14.1 \%). The number of patients accessing to emergency room went from 66 to 61 \% (a reduction of 5 \%). The costs of these hospitalizations were reduced by 2.2 \%.
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of the dedicated SCS in our oncology department caused a net reduction by 3.2 \% of the number of unplanned hospitalizations of on-treatment cancer patients.},

Thirty-four patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors were treated (phase I study, modified 3+3 dose escalation; 5 cohorts; 3-16 mg taselisib once-daily capsule). Taselisib pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional; mean half-life was 40 hours. Frequent dose-dependent, treatment-related adverse events included diarrhea, hyperglycemia, decreased appetite, nausea, rash, stomatitis, and vomiting. At 12 and 16 mg dose levels, dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were observed, with an accumulation of higher-grade adverse events after the cycle 1 DLT assessment window. Pharmacodynamic findings showed pathway inhibition at ≥3 mg in patient tumor samples, consistent with preclinical PIK3CA-mutant tumor xenograft models. Confirmed response rate was 36\% for PIK3CA-mutant tumor patients with measurable disease [5/14: 4 breast cancer (3 patients at 12 mg); 1 non-small cell lung cancer], where responses started at 3 mg, and 0\% in patients with tumors without known PIK3CA hotspot mutations (0/15).Significance: Preliminary data consistent with preclinical data indicate increased antitumor activity of taselisib in patients with PIK3CA-mutant tumors (in comparison with patients with tumors without known activating PIK3CA hotspot mutations) starting at the lowest dose tested of 3 mg, thereby supporting higher potency for taselisib against PIK3CA-mutant tumors.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hyaluronan accumulation in tumour stroma is associated with reduced survival in preclinical cancer models. PEGPH20 degrades hyaluronan to facilitate tumour access for cancer therapies. Our objective was to assess safety and antitumour activity of PEGPH20 in patients with advanced solid tumours.
METHODS: In HALO-109-101 (N=14), PEGPH20 was administered intravenously once or twice weekly (0.5 or 50 μg kg-1) or once every 3 weeks (0.5-1.5 μg kg-1). In HALO-109-102 (N=27), PEGPH20 was administered once or twice weekly (0.5-5.0 μg kg-1), with dexamethasone predose and postdose.
RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicities included grade ⩾3 myalgia, arthralgia, and muscle spasms; the maximum tolerated dose was 3.0 μg kg-1 twice weekly. Plasma hyaluronan increased in a dose-dependent manner, achieving steady state by Day 8 in multidose studies. A decrease in tumour hyaluronan level was observed in 5 of the 6 patients with pretreatment and posttreatment tumour biopsies. Exploratory imaging showed changes in tumour perfusion and decreased tumour metabolic activity, consistent with observations in animal models.
CONCLUSIONS: The tumour stroma has emerging importance in the development of cancer therapeutics. PEGPH20 3.0 μg kg-1 administered twice weekly is feasible in patients with advanced cancers; exploratory analyses indicate antitumour activity supporting further evaluation of PEGPH20 in solid tumours.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication 26 September 2017; doi:10.1038/bjc.2017.327 www.bjcancer.com.},

The phase III PROSELICA study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01308580) assessed the noninferiority of cabazitaxel 20 mg/m2 (C20) versus C25 in postdocetaxel patients with mCRPC.MethodsPatients were stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, measurability of disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), and region, and randomly assigned to receive C20 or C25. To claim noninferiority of C20 (maintenance of ≥ 50\% of the OS benefit of C25 v mitoxantrone in TROPIC) with 95\% confidence level, the upper boundary of the CI of the hazard ratio (HR) for C20 versus C25 could not exceed 1.214 under a one-sided 98.89\% CI after interim analyses. Secondary end points included progression-free survival, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), tumor and pain responses and progression, health-related quality of life, and safety.ResultsOverall, 1,200 patients were randomly assigned (C20, n = 598; C25, n = 602). Baseline characteristics were similar in both arms. Median OS was 13.4 months for C20 and 14.5 months for C25 (HR, 1.024). The upper boundary of the HR CI was 1.184 (less than the 1.214 noninferiority margin). Significant differences were observed in favor of C25 for PSA response (C20, 29.5\%; C25, 42.9\%; nominal P {\textless} .001) and time to PSA progression (median: C20, 5.7 months; C25, 6.8 months; HR for C20 v C25, 1.195; 95\% CI, 1.025 to 1.393). Health-related quality of life did not differ between cohorts. Rates of grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were 39.7\% for C20 and 54.5\% for C25.ConclusionThe efficacy of cabazitaxel in postdocetaxel patients with mCRPC was confirmed. The noninferiority end point was met; C20 maintained ≥ 50\% of the OS benefit of C25 versus mitoxantrone in TROPIC. Secondary efficacy end points favored C25. Fewer adverse events were observed with C20.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Medical doctors' (MDs), but not patients', perception of supportive care in cancer (SCC) in France has been previously assessed in a national survey. This study evaluated MDs and patients' perceptions of the SCC organization and implementation in France.
METHODS: The French SCC Association conducted two observational studies: study 1 (S1), containing a 30-point questionnaire sent to 2263 MDs, and study 2 (S2), containing a 40-point questionnaire sent to 2000 patients.
RESULTS: Overall, 711 MDs completed S1 and 1562 patients completed S2. In S1, 81\% of MDs reported relying on a SCC organization and 76\% attended SCC multidisciplinary discussions. MDs considered palliative (98\%), psychological (98\%), and social care (98\%) as the top 3 SCC areas of importance for patients. In contrast, patients' priorities were psychology (61\%), nutrition (55\%) and organization of intake consultations (55\%). The concept of SCC was familiar to 34\% of patients; according to MDs, this concept was introduced mainly by MDs (78\%) and admission nurses (41\%). Outpatients identified as professional resources for SCC information general practitioners (84\%), nurses (58\%), and pharmacists (52\%). Patients reported supportive treatment being prescribed in 63\% of cases, with 64\% receiving information on the negative side-effects. Among MDs, 87\% reported proposing palliative and 41\% adjuvant SCC treatment. Furthermore, 72\% of MDs recommended SCC treatment at the metastatic stage, and 36\% immediately following diagnosis.
DISCUSSION: Oncologists play a vital role in enhancing SCC efficacy. This can be increased by implementing a multidisciplinary integrated approach or by assuring the availability of patient information.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most difficult-to-treat cancers. With an increasing incidence and inability to make major progress, it represents the very definition of unmet medical need. Progress has been made in understanding the basic biology-systematic genomic sequencing has led to the recognition that PDAC is not typically a heavily mutated tumor, although there are exceptions. The most consistently mutated genes are KRAS, CDKN2A, TP53, and SMAD4/DPC4 Study of familial PDAC has led to the recognition that a variety of defects in DNA repair genes can be associated with the emergence of pancreatic cancer. Recent studies suggest that epigenetics may play a larger role than previously recognized. A major new understanding is the recognition that PDAC should be considered a composite of tumor cells, as well as pancreatic stellate cells, immune cells, and extracellular matrix. The individual components contribute to metabolic aberration, immune dysfunction, and chemotherapy resistance, and therapeutic innovations may be needed to address them individually. It has also been recognized that metastatic seeding from PDAC occurs very early in the disease course-in an estimated 73\% of cases, once the tumor reaches 2 cm. The implication of this is that therapies directed toward micrometastatic disease and increasing fractional cell kill are most needed. Neoadjuvant approaches have been taken to increase resectability and improve outcome. So much work remains, and most critical is the need to understand how this tumor originates and develops.

The patient developed BP with increasing serum titres of anti-BP180 IgG autoantibodies and increasing disease severity during pembrolizumab therapy. High doses of corticosteroids and methotrexate were needed to control the BP. Following the termination of pembrolizumab therapy, imaging showed complete regression of all metastatic sites.

	abstract = {Background Pharmacological inhibition of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) represents a new approach for the treatment of solid tumors. This study was aimed at determining the first cycle dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and related maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of NMS-1286937, a selective ATP-competitive PLK1-specific inhibitor. Secondary objectives included evaluation of its safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in plasma, its antitumor activity, and its ability to modulate intracellular targets in biopsied tissue. Methods This was a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation trial in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors. A treatment cycle comprised 5 days of oral administration followed by 16 days of rest, for a total of 21 days (3-week cycle). Results Nineteen of 21 enrolled patients with confirmed metastatic disease received study medication. No DLTs occurred at the first 3 dose levels (6, 12, and 24 mg/m2/day). At the subsequent dose level (48 mg/m2/day), 2 of 3 patients developed DLTs. An intermediate level of 36 mg/m2/day was therefore investigated. Four patients were treated and two DLTs were observed. After further cohort expansion, the MTD and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) were determined to be 24 mg/m2/day. Disease stabilization, observed in several patients, was the best treatment response observed. Hematological toxicity (mostly thrombocytopenia and neutropenia) was the major DLT. Systemic exposure to NMS-1286937 increased with dose and was comparable between two cycles of treatment following oral administration of the drug. Conclusions This study successfully identified the MTD and DLTs for NMS-1286937 and characterized its safety profile.},

	issn = {2038-2529},
	doi = {10.5301/tj.5000627},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Among patients with solid or hematologic malignancies undergoing oncologic therapies, blood product transfusions (BPT) are a relevant reason for planned/unplanned hospitalizations, as well as a possible cause of delay in administration of the oncologic therapies. Furthermore, they create additional costs for the healthcare system (HCS). The aim of this study was to compare the costs of performing BPT (erythrocytes and platelets) in medical units/wards to the costs derived from the administration of BPT in a dedicated outpatient supportive care in cancer unit (SCCU).
METHODS: Costs were analyzed from June 3, 2009 (when the SCCU started), until December 2013. Four inpatient oncologic units (bone marrow transplantation, radiotherapy, medical oncology I and II) were compared to the SCCU. Data regarding the transfusions performed by the SCCU of the patients who were previously hospitalized for transfusions were extracted, checked, and analyzed through a cross-check on the tax codes. Therefore, patients were considered suitable for the analysis if they had received BPT in the SCCU after a previous hospitalization for transfusion in one of the 4 units/wards. The average daily cost deriving from blood product units and from the hospitalization in each ward (irrespective of pharmaceutical expenses) was compared with the average daily cost deriving from blood product units and from the management of patients in the SCCU.
RESULTS: We analyzed 227 patients (112 female) with a mean age of 60 years (range 20-90) with hematologic malignancies in 79\% of cases. The number of transfusions performed by the SCCU has grown constantly and consistently over the years, reaching 1,402 transfusions in 2013, thus exceeding the other considered units. The total savings for the HCS was €282.204.71, €151.182.85 in 2013 only. We saved €124.319,26 for each patient transfused at the SCCU.
CONCLUSIONS: A dedicated outpatient SCCU, aimed at monitoring and treating cancer therapy-related toxicities and comorbidities and in which it is also possible to perform BPT promptly and effectively, reduces the number of hospitalizations and provides an economical benefit for HCS.},

The current analysis evaluated the effects of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine on primary pancreatic and metastatic lesions.
METHODS: In this analysis of the previously described MPACT trial, changes in pancreatic and metastatic tumor burden were assessed using independently measured diameters of lesions on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans. Changes in the sums of longest tumor diameters were summarized using descriptive statistics and were included in a multivariate analysis of overall survival.
RESULTS: Primary pancreatic lesion measurement was feasible. Reductions in primary pancreatic tumor burden and metastatic burden from baseline to nadir were significantly greater with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine. Baseline pancreatic tumor burden was independently predictive of survival. Both regimens elicited linear reductions in primary pancreatic and metastatic tumor burden through time. There was a high within-patient concordance of tumor changes between primary pancreatic lesions and metastatic lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of MPACT demonstrated significant tumor shrinkage benefit for nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in both primary pancreatic and metastatic lesions, supporting ongoing evaluation of this regimen in locally advanced disease.},

	abstract = {Background: The choice of a regimen in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients following progression on 1st line therapy is empiric and outcomes are unsatisfactory. This phase II study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of therapy selected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in these patients following progression after one or more therapies.
Methods: Eligible patients underwent a percutaneous biopsy of a metastatic lesion and treatment selection was determined by IHC. The study required 35 evaluable patients (power of 86\%) for detecting a true 1-year survival rate of {\textgreater}20\%.
Results: A tumor biopsy was performed in 48 of 49 accrued patients. Study therapy was not given (n=13) either due to insufficient tumor on biopsy (n=8) or due to worsening cancer related symptoms after biopsy (n=5). The demographics of evaluable patients (n=35) are male/female (59\%/41\%), with age range 34-78 years (median 63 years). Patients had 1-6 prior regimens (median of 2). The most common IHC targets were topoisomerase 1 or 2, thymidylate synthase, excision repair cross-complementation group 1 protein (ERCC1), and osteonectin secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC). Commercially available treatment regimens prescribed included FOLFIRI, FOLFOX, irinotecan, and doxorubicin. The response (RECIST) was 9\%, the median survival was 5.6 months (94\% CI, 3.8-8.2), and the 1-year survival was 20\% (95\% CI, 7-33\%).
Conclusions: In all patients, IHC assays resulted in identification of at least two targets for therapy and a non-cross resistant regimen could be prescribed for therapy with evidence of some benefit. An IHC based treatment strategy is feasible and needs validation in larger studies.},

	abstract = {Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) frequently harbors genetic alterations that activate the B cell receptor (BCR) and TLR pathways, which converge to activate NF-κB. While selective inhibition of BTK with ibrutinib causes clinical responses in relapsed DLBCL patients, most responses are partial and of a short duration. Here, we demonstrated that MyD88 silencing enhanced ibrutinib efficacy in DLBCL cells harboring MyD88 L265P mutations. Chemical downregulation of MyD88 expression with HDAC inhibitors also synergized with ibrutinib. We demonstrate that HDAC inhibitor regulation of MyD88 expression is mediated by STAT3. In turn, STAT3 silencing caused a decrease in MyD88 mRNA and protein levels, and enhanced the ibrutinib antilymphoma effect in MyD88 mutant DLBCL cells. Induced mutations in the STAT3 binding site in the MyD88 promotor region was associated with a decrease in MyD88 transcriptional activity. We also demonstrate that treatment with the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat decreased phosphorylated STAT3 binding to the MyD88 promotor. Accordingly, combined treatment with panobinostat and ibrutinib resulted in enhanced inhibition of NF-κB activity and caused regression of DLBCL xenografts. Our data provide a mechanistic rationale for combining HDAC inhibitors and ibrutinib for the treatment of DLBCL.},

We herein report the results of the dose-finding phase.
METHODS: The dose-finding phase sought to evaluate the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities and determine the recommended number of cycles of the intra-arterial infusion of cisplatin. In this phase, 100 mg/m2 of cisplatin was administered intra-arterially weekly for 7 weeks with concomitant radiotherapy (70 Gy).
RESULTS: All 18 patients received a full dose of radiotherapy. The number of cycles of cisplatin was 7 in 13 patients and 6 in 5 patients. The dose-limiting toxicities were observed in 5 patients.
CONCLUSION: These results indicated that this therapy is safe and well-tolerated at 7 cycles of cisplatin, which was determined to be the recommended number of cycles for locally advanced maxillary sinus SCC.},

A newer design, such as the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design, provides better accuracy to identify the MTD but tends to overdose patients. We propose the keyboard design, an intuitive Bayesian design that conducts dose escalation and de-escalation based on whether the strongest key, defined as the dosing interval that most likely contains the current dose, is below or above the target dosing interval. The keyboard design can be implemented in a simple way, similar to the traditional 3+3 design, but provides more flexibility for choosing the target toxicity rate and cohort size. Our simulation studies demonstrate that compared with the 3+3 design, the keyboard design has favorable operating characteristics in terms of identifying the MTD. Compared with the mTPI design, the keyboard design is safer, with a substantially lower risk of treating patients at overly toxic doses, and has the better precision to identify the MTD, thereby providing a useful upgrade to the mTPI design.

	abstract = {PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: SBRT is used to treat oligometastatic or unresectable primary abdominal malignancies, although ablative dose delivery is limited by proximity of organs-at-risk (OAR). Stereotactic, magnetic resonance (MR)-guided online-adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) may improve SBRT's therapeutic ratio. This prospective Phase I trial assessed feasibility and potential advantages of SMART to treat abdominal malignancies.
MATERIALS/METHODS: Twenty patients with oligometastatic or unresectable primary liver (n = 10) and non-liver (n = 10) abdominal malignancies underwent SMART. Initial plans prescribed 50 Gy/5 fractions (BED 100 Gy) with goal 95\% PTV coverage by 95\% of prescription, subject to hard OAR constraints. Daily real-time online-adaptive plans were created as needed, based on daily setup MR-image-set tumor/OAR "anatomy-of-the-day" to preserve hard OAR constraints, escalate PTV dose, or both. Treatment times, patient outcomes, and dosimetric comparisons between initial and adaptive plans were prospectively recorded.
RESULTS: Online adaptive plans were created at time of treatment for 81/97 fractions, due to initial plan violation of OAR constraints (61/97) or observed opportunity for PTV dose escalation (20/97). Plan adaptation increased PTV coverage in 64/97 fractions. Zero Grade ≥ 3 acute ({\textless}6 months) treatment-related toxicities were observed.
DISCUSSION: SMART is clinically deliverable and safe, allowing PTV dose escalation and/or simultaneous OAR sparing compared to non-adaptive abdominal SBRT.},

	abstract = {The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors [monoclonal antibodies targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)] represents a major breakthrough in cancer therapy. Although they present a favorable risk/benefit ratio, immune checkpoint blockade therapies have a very specific safety profile. Due to their unique mechanism of action, they entail a new spectrum of adverse events that are mostly immune related [immune-related adverse events (irAEs)], notably mediated by the triggering of cytotoxic CD4+/CD8+ T cell activation. Cutaneous toxicities appear to be one of the most prevalent irAEs, both with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 agents or with the newly developed anti-PD-L1 agents, which corresponds to a class effect. They are observed in more than one-third of the treated patients, mainly in the form of a maculopapular rash (eczema-like spongiotic dermatitis) and pruritus. A wide range of other dermatologic manifestations can also occur, including lichenoid reactions, psoriasis, acneiform rashes, vitiligo-like lesions, autoimmune skin diseases (e.g., bullous pemphigoid, dermatomyositis, alopecia areata), sarcoidosis or nail and oral mucosal changes. In addition, the use of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapies in combination is associated with the development of more frequent, more severe and earlier cutaneous irAEs compared to single agents. In most cases, these dysimmune dermatologic adverse events remain self-limiting and readily manageable. Early recognition and adequate management, however, are critical to prevent exacerbation of the lesions, to limit treatment interruption and to minimize quality of life impairment. This review describes the variable clinical and histopathologic aspects of dermatologic irAEs induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors. Appropriate treatment and counseling are also proposed, with a step-by-step approach for optimized management by both practicing oncologists and dermatologists.},

Nonlichenoid patterns may also occur and are likely to be encountered by surgical pathologists, given the increasing clinical use of these agents. The purpose of this study is to describe the histopathologic features of nonlichenoid cutaneous irAEs from patients receiving anti-programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 therapies for a variety of underlying advanced malignancies. Sixteen patients with 17 biopsied eruptions were included from 2 academic institutions with extensive experience administering and monitoring responses to immune checkpoint blockade as well as treating the potential side effects. Eruptions occurred a median of 10 days (range, 1 d to 11.4 mo) after treatment initiation. Nearly half of specimens demonstrated either a psoriasiform/spongiotic or an urticarial-type reaction pattern on histologic review. Patterns consistent with Grover disease, bullous pemphigoid, and granulomatous dermatitis were also observed. Nearly two-thirds of patients required systemic corticosteroids for treatment of the cutaneous irAE, and 19\% of patients discontinued immunotherapy due to their skin eruptions. 75\% of patients showed an objective antitumor response. The diverse array of nonlichenoid cutaneous irAE presented here should reflect and inform the scope of histologic patterns encountered by the practicing surgical pathologist. Such eruptions are seen in patients with a variety of underlying tumor types, many of whom ultimately demonstrate a favorable response to immune checkpoint blockade.},

Distinctive clinical and histologic subtypes of dermatologic toxicity secondary to immunotherapy are emerging and include rare autoimmune bullous reactions (eg, bullous pemphigoid) and lichenoid eruptions. We report three patients who developed lichenoid dermatitis while receiving anti-PD-1 antibody therapy. The mean time to onset of lichenoid dermatologic toxicity was 42 days (range: 1-75 days) from initiation of anti-PD-1 antibody therapy. Lesions most frequently presented on the extremities and trunk as pustules, papules, and plaques. The face was not commonly involved. Of the five skin biopsies examined, all demonstrated dense band-like lymphocytic infiltrate, hyperkeratosis, hypergranulosis, saw-tooth rete ridge pattern, and dyskeratosis. Acanthosis was a feature in all of the skin biopsies, and in one, epidermal hyperplasia was prominent. In several skin biopsies, histologic features supporting a lichenoid drug eruption were present, including parakeratosis, spongiosis, periadnexal/perivascular inflammation, and eosinophils. Furthermore, the histologic features varied in skin biopsy specimens taken from the same patient at different sites, supporting a drug reaction. All patients' skin lesions improved with use of steroids: two were treated with topical steroids and one with systemic steroids.

We report our experience with five patients who presented with pruritic vesicles and blisters on the skin while treated with anti-PD-1 antibody immunotherapy with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab. Four of the patients' skin biopsies revealed subepidermal bullae with immunohistochemical study for type IV collagen labeling the floor of the blister cavity and direct immunofluorescence studies (in three of the four patients tested) decorated linear IgG and C3 immune deposits on the blister roof, diagnostic of bullous pemphigoid. One patient developed bullous erythema multiforme.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Ibrutinib is an oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, recently approved for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with at least one prior therapy. We developed a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for ibrutinib in patients.
METHODS: Ibrutinib PK data (3,477 observations/245 patients) were available from the following clinical studies: (1) A phase I dose-escalation study in recurrent B cell malignancies (dose levels of 1.25-12.5 mg/kg/day and fixed dose of 560 mg/day); (2) a phase II study in MCL (fixed dose level of 560 mg/day); (3) a phase Ib/II dose-finding study in CLL (fixed dose levels of 420 and 840 mg/day). Different compartmental PK models were explored using nonlinear mixed effects modeling.
RESULTS: A two-compartment PK model with sequential zero-first-order absorption and first-order elimination was able to characterize the PK of ibrutinib. The compound was rapidly absorbed, had a high oral plasma clearance (approximately 1,000 L/h) and a high apparent volume of distribution at steady state (approximately 10,000 L). PK parameters were not dependent on dose, study, or clinical indication. The fasting state was characterized by a 67 \% relative bioavailability compared with the meal conditions used in the trials and administration after a high-fat meal. Body weight and coadministration of antacids marginally increased volume of distribution and duration of absorption, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed population PK model was able to describe the plasma concentration-time profiles of ibrutinib across various trials. The linear model indicated that the compound's PK was dose independent and time independent.},

	abstract = {The two major subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)--activated B cell-like (ABC) and germinal center B cell-like (GCB)--arise by distinct mechanisms, with ABC selectively acquiring mutations that target the B cell receptor (BCR), fostering chronic active BCR signaling. The ABC subtype has a ∼40\% cure rate with currently available therapies, which is worse than the rate for GCB DLBCL, and highlights the need for ABC subtype-specific treatment strategies. We hypothesized that ABC, but not GCB, DLBCL tumors would respond to ibrutinib, an inhibitor of BCR signaling. In a phase 1/2 clinical trial that involved 80 subjects with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, ibrutinib produced complete or partial responses in 37\% (14/38) of those with ABC DLBCL, but in only 5\% (1/20) of subjects with GCB DLBCL (P = 0.0106). ABC tumors with BCR mutations responded to ibrutinib frequently (5/9; 55.5\%), especially those with concomitant myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) mutations (4/5; 80\%), a result that is consistent with in vitro cooperation between the BCR and MYD88 pathways. However, the highest number of responses occurred in ABC tumors that lacked BCR mutations (9/29; 31\%), suggesting that oncogenic BCR signaling in ABC does not require BCR mutations and might be initiated by non-genetic mechanisms. These results support the selective development of ibrutinib for the treatment of ABC DLBCL.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Survival and progression of mature B-cell malignancies depend on signals from the B-cell antigen receptor, and Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a critical signaling kinase in this pathway. We evaluated ibrutinib (PCI-32765), a small-molecule irreversible inhibitor of BTK, in patients with B-cell malignancies.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia received escalating oral doses of ibrutinib. Two schedules were evaluated: one, 28 days on, 7 days off; and two, once-daily continuous dosing. Occupancy of BTK by ibrutinib in peripheral blood was monitored using a fluorescent affinity probe. Dose escalation proceeded until either the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was achieved or, in the absence of MTD, until three dose levels above full BTK occupancy by ibrutinib. Response was evaluated every two cycles.
RESULTS: Fifty-six patients with a variety of B-cell malignancies were treated over seven cohorts. Most adverse events were grade 1 and 2 in severity and self-limited. Dose-limiting events were not observed, even with prolonged dosing. Full occupancy of the BTK active site occurred at 2.5 mg/kg per day, and dose escalation continued to 12.5 mg/kg per day without reaching MTD. Pharmacokinetic data indicated rapid absorption and elimination, yet BTK occupancy was maintained for at least 24 hours, consistent with the irreversible mechanism. Objective response rate in 50 evaluable patients was 60\%, including complete response of 16\%. Median progression-free survival in all patients was 13.6 months.
CONCLUSION: Ibrutinib, a novel BTK-targeting inhibitor, is well tolerated, with substantial activity across B-cell histologies.},

The mean (S.D.) cumulative excretion of radioactivity of the dose was 7.8\% (1.4\%) in urine and 80.6\% (3.1\%) in feces with {\textless}1\% excreted as parent ibrutinib. Only oxidative metabolites and very limited parent compound were detected in feces, and this indicated that ibrutinib was completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Metabolism occurred via three major pathways (hydroxylation of the phenyl (M35), opening of the piperidine (M25 and M34), and epoxidation of the ethylene on the acryloyl moiety with further hydrolysis to dihydrodiol (PCI-45227, and M37). Additional metabolites were formed by combinations of the primary metabolic pathways or by further metabolism. In blood and plasma, a rapid initial decline in radioactivity was observed along with long terminal elimination half-life for total radioactivity. The maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for total radioactivity were higher in plasma compared with blood. The main circulating entities in blood and plasma were M21 (sulfate conjugate of a monooxidized metabolite on phenoxyphenyl), M25, M34, M37 (PCI-45227), and ibrutinib. At Cmax of radioactivity, 12\% of total radioactivity was accounted for by covalent binding in human plasma. More than 50\% of total plasma radioactivity was attributed to covalently bound material from 8 hours onward; as a result, covalent binding accounted for 38\% and 51\% of total radioactivity AUC0–24 h and AUC0–72 h, respectively. No effect of CYP2D6 genotype was observed on ibrutinib metabolism. Ibrutinib was well-tolerated by healthy participants.},

Given the frequency of immune related adverse events and increasing use of ICB, predictors of response to CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 blockade represent unmet clinical needs. Using a systems biology-based approach to an assessment of 779 paired blood and tumor markers in 37 stage III MMel patients, we analyzed association between blood immune parameters and the functional immune reactivity of tumor-infiltrating cells after ex vivo exposure to ICB. Based on this assay, we retrospectively observed, in eight cohorts enrolling 190 MMel patients treated with ipilimumab, that PD-L1 expression on peripheral T cells was prognostic on overall and progression-free survival. Moreover, detectable CD137 on circulating CD8+ T cells was associated with the disease-free status of resected stage III MMel patients after adjuvant ipilimumab + nivolumab (but not nivolumab alone). These biomarkers should be validated in prospective trials in MMel.The clinical management of metastatic melanoma requires predictors of the response to checkpoint blockade. Here, the authors use immunological assays to identify potential prognostic/predictive biomarkers in circulating blood cells and in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from patients with resected stage III melanoma.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-positive ALL) is frequently caused by mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain. Ponatinib (AP24534) is a potent oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks native and mutated BCR-ABL, including the gatekeeper mutant T315I, which is uniformly resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
METHODS: In this phase 1 dose-escalation study, we enrolled 81 patients with resistant hematologic cancers, including 60 with CML and 5 with Ph-positive ALL. Ponatinib was administered once daily at doses ranging from 2 to 60 mg. Median follow-up was 56 weeks (range, 2 to 140).
RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxic effects included elevated lipase or amylase levels and pancreatitis. Common adverse events were rash, myelosuppression, and constitutional symptoms. Among Ph-positive patients, 91\% had received two or more approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and 51\% had received all three approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Of 43 patients with chronic-phase CML, 98\% had a complete hematologic response, 72\% had a major cytogenetic response, and 44\% had a major molecular response. Of 12 patients who had chronic-phase CML with the T315I mutation, 100\% had a complete hematologic response and 92\% had a major cytogenetic response. Of 13 patients with chronic-phase CML without detectable mutations, 100\% had a complete hematologic response and 62\% had a major cytogenetic response. Responses among patients with chronic-phase CML were durable. Of 22 patients with accelerated-phase or blast-phase CML or Ph-positive ALL, 36\% had a major hematologic response and 32\% had a major cytogenetic response.
CONCLUSIONS: Ponatinib was highly active in heavily pretreated patients with Ph-positive leukemias with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including patients with the BCR-ABL T315I mutation, other mutations, or no mutations.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ponatinib is a potent oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor of unmutated and mutated BCR-ABL, including BCR-ABL with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor-refractory threonine-to-isoleucine mutation at position 315 (T315I). We conducted a phase 2 trial of ponatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-positive ALL).
METHODS: We enrolled 449 heavily pretreated patients who had CML or Ph-positive ALL with resistance to or unacceptable side effects from dasatinib or nilotinib or who had the BCR-ABL T315I mutation. Ponatinib was administered at an initial dose of 45 mg once daily. The median follow-up was 15 months.
RESULTS: Among 267 patients with chronic-phase CML, 56\% had a major cytogenetic response (51\% of patients with resistance to or unacceptable side effects from dasatinib or nilotinib and 70\% of patients with the T315I mutation), 46\% had a complete cytogenetic response (40\% and 66\% in the two subgroups, respectively), and 34\% had a major molecular response (27\% and 56\% in the two subgroups, respectively). Responses were observed regardless of the baseline BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation status and were durable; the estimated rate of a sustained major cytogenetic response of at least 12 months was 91\%. No single BCR-ABL mutation conferring resistance to ponatinib was detected. Among 83 patients with accelerated-phase CML, 55\% had a major hematologic response and 39\% had a major cytogenetic response. Among 62 patients with blast-phase CML, 31\% had a major hematologic response and 23\% had a major cytogenetic response. Among 32 patients with Ph-positive ALL, 41\% had a major hematologic response and 47\% had a major cytogenetic response. Common adverse events were thrombocytopenia (in 37\% of patients), rash (in 34\%), dry skin (in 32\%), and abdominal pain (in 22\%). Serious arterial thrombotic events were observed in 9\% of patients; these events were considered to be treatment-related in 3\%. A total of 12\% of patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event.
CONCLUSIONS: Ponatinib had significant antileukemic activity across categories of disease stage and mutation status. (Funded by Ariad Pharmaceuticals and others; PACE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01207440 .).},

	doi = {10.1002/jcsm.12201},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia is a syndrome of weight loss (including muscle and fat), anorexia, and decreased physical function. It has been suggested that the optimal treatment for cachexia should be a multimodal intervention. The primary aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and safety of a multimodal intervention (n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid nutritional supplements, exercise, and anti-inflammatory medication: celecoxib) for cancer cachexia in patients with incurable lung or pancreatic cancer, undergoing chemotherapy.
METHODS: Patients receiving two cycles of standard chemotherapy were randomized to either the multimodal cachexia intervention or standard care. Primary outcome measures were feasibility assessed by recruitment, attrition, and compliance with intervention ({\textgreater}50\% of components in {\textgreater}50\% of patients). Key secondary outcomes were change in weight, muscle mass, physical activity, safety, and survival.
RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety-nine were screened resulting in 46 patients recruited (11.5\%). Twenty five patients were randomized to the treatment and 21 as controls. Forty-one completed the study (attrition rate 11\%). Compliance to the individual components of the intervention was 76\% for celecoxib, 60\% for exercise, and 48\% for nutritional supplements. As expected from the sample size, there was no statistically significant effect on physical activity or muscle mass. There were no intervention-related Serious Adverse Events and survival was similar between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal cachexia intervention is feasible and safe in patients with incurable lung or pancreatic cancer; however, compliance to nutritional supplements was suboptimal. A phase III study is now underway to assess fully the effect of the intervention.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) affects one third of patients with cancer. Radiotherapy remains the gold-standard treatment; however, laboratory and clinical work suggest that pregabalin may be useful in treating CIBP. The aim of this study was to examine pregabalin in patients with CIBP receiving radiotherapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter, double-blind randomized trial of pregabalin versus placebo was conducted. Eligible patients were age ≥ 18 years, had radiologically proven bone metastases, were scheduled to receive radiotherapy, and had pain scores ≥ 4 of 10 (on 0-to-10 numeric rating scale). Before radiotherapy, baseline assessments were completed, followed by random assignment. Doses of pregabalin and placebo were increased over 4 weeks. The primary end point was treatment response, defined as a reduction of ≥ 2 points in worst pain by week 4, accompanied by a stable or reduced opioid dose, compared with baseline. Secondary end points assessed average pain, interference of pain with activity, breakthrough pain, mood, quality of life, and adverse events.
RESULTS: A total of 233 patients were randomly assigned: 117 to placebo and 116 to pregabalin. The most common cancers were prostate (n = 88; 38\%), breast (n = 77; 33\%), and lung (n = 42; 18\%). In the pregabalin arm, 45 patients (38.8\%) achieved the primary end point, compared with 47 (40.2\%) in the placebo arm (adjusted odds ratio, 1.07; 95\% CI, 0.63 to 1.81; P = .816). There were no statistically significant differences in average pain, pain interference, or quality of life between arms. There were differences in mood (P = .031) and breakthrough pain duration (P = .037) between arms. Outcomes were compared at 4 weeks.
CONCLUSION: Our findings do not support the role of pregabalin in patients with CIBP receiving radiotherapy. The role of pregabalin in CIBP with a clinical neuropathic pain component is unknown.},

In this paper, we build on the premise that the task of early-phase testing is to optimize various components of a potential therapy so that later, confirmatory trials have the maximal probability of informing drug development and clinical care. We then explore three strategies that investigators might use to manage trial risks while optimizing a therapy, using cell therapy for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) as an example. We argue that an iterative application of maximin strategies over successive cohorts and trials, which we call the "risk-escalation model," establishes a moral principle that should guide decision-making in early-phase trials.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous reviews of phase 1 oncology trials reported a rate of response to treatment of 4 to 6 percent and a toxicity-related death rate of 0.5 percent. These results may not reflect the rates in current phase 1 oncology trials.
METHODS: We reviewed all nonpediatric phase 1 oncology trials sponsored by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program at the National Cancer Institute between 1991 and 2002. We report the rates of response to treatment, of stable disease, of grade 4 toxic events, and of treatment-related deaths.
RESULTS: We analyzed 460 trials involving 11,935 participants, all of whom were assessed for toxicity and 10,402 of whom were assessed for a response to therapy. The overall response rate (i.e., for both complete and partial responses) was 10.6 percent, with considerable variation among trials. "Classic" phase 1 trials of single investigational chemotherapeutic agents represented only 20 percent of the trials and had a response rate of 4.4 percent. Studies that included at least one anticancer agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration constituted 46.3 percent of the trials and had a response rate of 17.8. An additional 34.1 percent of participants had stable disease or a less-than-partial response. The overall rate of death due to toxic events was 0.49 percent. Of 3465 participants for whom data on patient-specific grade 4 toxic events were available, 14.3 percent had had at least one episode of grade 4 toxic events.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall response rates among phase 1 oncology trials are higher than previously reported, although they have not changed for classic phase 1 trials, and toxicity-related death rates have remained stable. Rates of response and toxicity vary, however, among the various types of phase 1 oncology trials.},

	abstract = {Oxalato-platinum in a new platinum derivative which was found to be active in experimental tumors and devoid of nephrotoxicity. A phase I study was conducted in cancer patients according to a new design following the recommendations of our Institution's ethical committee to avoid the major drawback of classical phase I studies in which many patients receive the experimental drug at doses far under the potentially active dose extrapolated from experimental studies. The potentially active dose of l-OHP was determined from the Maximally Efficient Dose Range (MEDR) to be between 45 mg/m2 (subcurative dose) and 67 mg/m2 (subtoxic dose). The patients in this study received with increasing intervals 1/100, 1/10, 1/5, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 1, of the low dose of the MEDR, this dose being reached after 90 to 120 days on study. 23 evaluable patients have entered the trial of which 19 reached the low dose of MEDR (45 mg/m2). Gastro-intestinal toxicity, nausea and vomiting, similar to those with CDDP occurred in all patients at or above the dose of 30 mg/m2. Renal toxicity was monitored with creatinine level and did not occur in any patient at any dose nor did significant hematologic toxicity occur. Thus nausea and vomiting appear to be the limiting toxicity of the drug. Responses were observed in this phase I study in lung cancer (1), breast cancer (1), melanoma (1) and perhaps hepatoma (major decrease in alpha FP levels) (1). The proposed starting dose for phase II studies is 45 mg/m2 but we plan to continue dose escalation during the phase II according to the design of Jones and Holland. This new study design allows each patient entering a phase I study to be treated with a potentially active dose of the drug studied.},

The most prominent barriers to implementation of a model-based design were lack of suitable training, chief investigators’ preference for algorithm-based designs (e.g., 3+3), and limited resources for study design before funding. We use a real-world example to illustrate how these barriers can be overcome.Conclusions:There is overwhelming evidence for the benefits of CRM. Many leading pharmaceutical companies routinely implement model-based designs. Our analysis identified barriers for academic statisticians and clinical academics in mirroring the progress industry has made in trial design. Unified support from funders, regulators, and journal editors could result in more accurate doses for later-phase testing, and increase the efficiency and success of clinical drug development. We give recommendations for increasing the uptake of model-based designs for dose-finding trials in academia.},

In these situations, instead of determining a dose that works for every patient, the trial aims to identify a dosing algorithm that prescribes dose according to the patient's biomarker or pharmacokinetic expression. Specifically, we aim to dose patients around a pre-specified level of area under the curve of irinotecan concentration using the patients' baseline phenotypes that predict drug clearance. We propose least squares recursion procedures to estimate the dosing algorithm sequentially with an aim to treat patients in the trial around the true unknown dosing algorithm, and introduce a novel application of an eigenvalue theory that guarantees convergence to the true dosing algorithms. Our simulation study demonstrates that using an eigenvalue constraint improves the efficiency of the recursion by as large as 40\%, while concentrating in-trial patient allocation around the true dosing algorithm. We also provide practical guidance on design calibration, and design future irinotecan studies based on data from our first trial.},

	abstract = {Background

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of asparaginase is necessary to respond to variability in asparaginase activity levels, detect silent inactivation, and distinguish between real allergies and allergic-like reactions with and without asparaginase neutralization, respectively. In this study, the costs of an individualized and fixed asparaginase dosing schedule were compared.


Procedure

Patients, treated according to the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group ALL-11 protocol (individualized PEGasparaginase treatment, starting dose: 1,500 IU/m2) or ALL-10 protocol (native Escherichia coli asparaginase followed by 2,500 IU/m2 PEGasparaginase), were included. To focus on TDM of PEGasparaginase, the costs were also calculated excluding patients treated with Erwinia asparaginase and compared to a hypothetical protocol with a fixed dose of 1,500 IU/m2 PEGasparaginase. Direct asparaginase-related medical costs, including costs for asparaginase use (calculated with the absolute dose), TDM, laboratory tests, daycare treatment, and outpatient clinic visits, were calculated.


Results

Eighty-three ALL-10 patients and 51 ALL-11 patients were included. The asparaginase-related costs were 30.8\% lower in ALL-11 than in ALL-10 (\$29,048 vs. \$41,960). The ALL-11 costs of nonallergic patients were 20.4\% lower, when using TDM, than the hypothetical protocol with a fixed dose of 1,500 IU/m2 (\$13,178 vs. \$16,551). TDM accounted for 12.4\% of the costs. Including asparaginase waste, TDM in ALL-11 will be cost saving if three doses can be prepared out of one vial compared to a fixed dose of 1,500 IU/m2.


Conclusions

TDM of asparaginase is cost saving if calculated with the absolute asparaginase dose and will be if the waste is minimalized by preparing multiple doses out of one vial.},

This choice is conditional on the modelling purpose as well as the amount and quality of the available data. The main advantage of PBPK models is that they can be used to extrapolate outside the studied population and experimental conditions. The trade-off for this advantage is a complex system of differential equations with a considerable number of model parameters. When these parameters cannot be informed from in vitro or in silico experiments they are usually optimized with respect to observed clinical data. Parameter estimation in complex models is a challenging task associated with many methodological issues which are discussed here with specific recommendations. Concepts such as structural and practical identifiability are described with regards to PBPK modelling and the value of experimental design and sensitivity analyses is sketched out. Parameter estimation approaches are discussed, while we also highlight the importance of not neglecting the covariance structure between model parameters and the uncertainty and population variability that is associated with them. Finally the possibility of using model order reduction techniques and minimal semi-mechanistic models that retain the physiological-mechanistic nature only in the parts of the model which are relevant to the desired modelling purpose is emphasized. Careful attention to all the above issues allows us to integrate successfully information from in vitro or in silico experiments together with information deriving from observed clinical data and develop mechanistically sound models with clinical relevance.},

The time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) is a Bayesian dose-finding design to address the issue of long observation time and early patient drop-out. It uses a weighted binomial likelihood with weights assigned to observations by the unknown time-to-toxicity distribution, and is open to accrual continually. To avoid dosing at overly toxic levels while retaining accuracy and efficiency for DLT evaluation that involves multiple cycles, we propose an adaptive weight function by incorporating cyclical data of the experimental treatment with parameters updated continually. This provides a reasonable estimate for the time-to-toxicity distribution by accounting for inter-cycle variability and maintains the statistical properties of consistency and coherence. A case study of a First-in-Human trial in cancer for an experimental biologic is presented using the proposed design. Design calibrations for the clinical and statistical parameters are conducted to ensure good operating characteristics. Simulation results show that the proposed TITE-CRM design with adaptive weight function yields significantly shorter trial duration, does not expose patients to additional risk, is competitive against the existing weighting methods, and possesses some desirable properties.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Phase I clinical trials are generally conducted to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the biologically active dose (BAD) using a traditional dose-escalation design. This design may not be applied to cancer vaccines, given their unique mechanism of action. The FDA recently published "Guidance for Industry: Clinical Considerations for Therapeutic Cancer Vaccines." However, many questions about the design of cancer vaccine studies remain unanswered.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed the toxicity profile in 239 phase I therapeutic cancer vaccine trials. We addressed the ability of dose escalation to determine the MTD or the BAD in trials that used a dose-escalation design.
RESULTS: The rate of grade 3/4 vaccine-related systemic toxicities was 1.25 adverse events per 100 patients and 2 per 1,000 vaccines. Only two of the 127 dose-escalation trials reported vaccine-related dose limiting toxicities, both of which used bacterial vector vaccines. Out of the 116 trials analyzed for the dose-immune response relationship, we found a statistically significant dose-immune response correlation only when the immune response was measured by antibodies (P {\textless} 0.001) or delayed type hypersensitivity (P {\textless} 0.05). However, the increase in cellular immune response did not appear further sustainable with the continued increase in dose.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that the risks of serious toxicities with therapeutic cancer vaccines are extremely low and that toxicities do not correlate with dose levels. Accordingly, the conventional dose-escalation design is not suitable for cancer vaccines with few exceptions. Here, we propose an alternative design for therapeutic cancer vaccine development.},

Because of these changes in focus, the National Cancer Institute and Investigational Drug Steering Committee's Task Force on Clinical Trial Design met to evaluate the most efficient ways to design and implement early clinical trials with novel therapeutics. Clinical approaches discussed included the conventional 3 + 3 cohort expansion phase 1 design, multi-institutional phase 1 studies, accelerated titration designs, continual reassessment methods, the study of specific target patient populations, and phase 0 studies. Each of these approaches uniquely contributes to some aspect of the phase 1 study, with all focused on dose and schedule determination, patient safety, and limited patient exposure to ineffective doses of investigational agent. The benefit of labor-intensive generation of preliminary biomarker evidence of target inhibition, as well as the value of molecular profiling of the study population, is considered. New drug development is expensive and the failure rate remains high. By identifying patient populations expected to respond to the study agent and tailoring the treatment with a novel drug, investigators will be one step closer to personalizing cancer treatment. The "fail early and fast" approach is acceptable if the appropriate patient population is evaluated in the phase 1 trial. The approaches outlined in this overview address the merits, advantages, disadvantages, and obstacles encountered during first in human studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Novel dose-finding designs for Phase I cancer clinical trials, using estimation to assign the best estimated Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) at each point in the experiment, most prominently via Bayesian techniques, have been widely discussed and promoted since 1990.
PURPOSE: To examine the small-sample behavior of these 'Bayesian Phase I' designs, and also of non-Bayesian designs sharing the same main 'Long-Memory' traits of using likelihood estimation and assigning the estimated MTD to the next patient.
METHODS: Data from several recently published experiments are presented and discussed, and Long-Memory designs' operating principles are explained. Simulation studies compare the small-sample behavior of Long-Memory designs with short-memory 'Up-and-Down' designs.
RESULTS: In simulation, Long-Memory and Up-and-Down designs achieved similar success rates in finding the MTD. However, for all Long-Memory designs examined, the number n (*) of cohorts treated at the true MTD was highly variable between simulated experiments drawn from the same toxicity-threshold distribution. Further investigation using the same set of thresholds in permuted order indicates that this Long-Memory behavior is driven by sensitivity to the order in which participants enter the experiment. This sensitivity is related to Long-Memory designs' 'winner-takes-all' dose-assignment rule, which grants the early cohorts a disproportionately large influence, and causes many experiments to settle early on a specific dose. Additionally for the Bayesian Long-Memory designs, the prior-predictive distribution over the dose levels has a substantial impact upon MTD-finding performance, long into the experiment.
LIMITATIONS: While the numerical evidence for Long-Memory designs' order sensitivity is broad, and plausible explanations for it are provided, we do not present a theoretical proof of the phenomenon.
CONCLUSIONS: Method developers, analysts, and practitioners should be aware of Long-Memory designs' order sensitivity and related phenomena. In particular, they should be informed that settling on a single dose does not guarantee that this dose is the MTD. Presently, Up-and-Down designs offer a simpler and more robust alternative for the sample sizes of 10-40 patients used in most Phase I trials. Future designs might benefit from combining the two approaches. We also suggest that the field's paradigm change from dose-selection to dose-estimation.},

Phase 1 pediatric oncology trials offer only a small chance of direct benefit and may have significant risks and an impact on quality of life. To date, research has not examined discussions of risks and benefits during informed consent conferences for phase 1 pediatric oncology trials. The objective of the current study was to examine clinician and family communication about risks, benefits, and quality of life during informed consent conferences for phase 1 pediatric oncology trials.

Methods
Participants included clinician investigators, parents, and children recruited from 6 sites conducting phase 1 pediatric oncology trials. Eighty-five informed consent conferences were observed and audiotaped. Trained coders assessed discussions of risks, benefits, and quality of life. Types of risks discussed were coded (e.g., unanticipated risks, digestive system risks, death). Types of benefits were categorized as therapeutic (e.g. discussion of how participation may or may not directly benefit child), psychological, bridge to future trial, and altruism.

Results
Risks and benefits were discussed in 95\% and 88\% of informed consent conferences, respectively. Therapeutic benefit was the most frequently discussed benefit. The impact of trial participation on quality of life was discussed in the majority (88\%) of informed consent conferences.

Conclusion
Therapeutic benefit, risks, and quality of life were frequently discussed. The range of information discussed during informed consent conferences suggests the need for considering a staged process of informed consent for phase 1 pediatric oncology trials.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been much work on early phase cancer designs that incorporate both toxicity and efficacy data, called phase I-II designs because they combine elements of both phases. However, they do not explicitly address the phase II hypothesis test of H0 : p ≤ p0 , where p is the probability of efficacy at the estimated maximum tolerated dose η from phase I and p0 is the baseline efficacy rate. Standard practice for phase II remains to treat p as a fixed, unknown parameter and to use Simon's two-stage design with all patients dosed at η. We propose a phase I-II design that addresses the uncertainty in the estimate p=p(η) in H0 by using sequential generalized likelihood theory. Combining this with a phase I design that incorporates efficacy data, the phase I-II design provides a common framework that can be used all the way from the first dose of phase I through the final accept/reject decision about H0 at the end of phase II, utilizing both toxicity and efficacy data throughout. Efficient group sequential testing is used in phase II that allows for early stopping to show treatment effect or futility. The proposed phase I-II design thus removes the artificial barrier between phase I and phase II and fulfills the objectives of searching for the maximum tolerated dose and testing if the treatment has an acceptable response rate to enter into a phase III trial.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This phase I, open-label, single-arm trial assessed the safety and tolerability of dacomitinib–figitumumab combination therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Experimental Design: A standard 3 + 3 dose escalation/de-escalation design was utilized. Starting doses were figitumumab 20 mg/kg administered intravenously once every 3 weeks and dacomitinib 30 mg administered orally once daily. We also performed an independent study of the combination in patient-derived xenograft (avatar mouse) models of adenoid cystic carcinoma.
Results: Of the 74 patients enrolled, the most common malignancies were non–small cell lung cancer (24.3\%) and colorectal cancer (14.9\%). The most common treatment-related adverse events in the 71 patients who received treatment across five dose levels were diarrhea (59.2\%), mucosal inflammation (47.9\%), and fatigue and acneiform dermatitis (45.1\% each). The most common dose-limiting toxicity was mucosal inflammation. Dosing schedules of dacomitinib 10 or 15 mg daily plus figitumumab 20 mg/kg every 3 weeks after a figitumumab loading dose were tolerated by patients over multiple cycles and considered recommended doses for further evaluation. Objective responses were seen in patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, and salivary gland cancer. Pharmacokinetic analysis did not show any significant drug−drug interaction. In the adenoid cystic carcinoma xenograft model, figitumumab exerted significant antitumor activity, whereas dacomitinib did not. Figitumumab-sensitive tumors showed downregulation of genes in the insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 pathway.
Conclusions: Dacomitinib−figitumumab combination therapy was tolerable with significant dose reductions of both agents to less than the recommended single-agent phase II dose of each drug. Preliminary clinical activity was demonstrated in the potential target tumor adenoid cystic carcinoma. Clin Cancer Res; 23(5); 1177–85. ©2016 AACR.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: ASP3026 is a second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor that has potent in vitro activity against crizotinib-resistant ALK-positive tumors. This open-label, multicenter, first-in-human phase I study ( NCT01284192 ) assessed the safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and antitumor activity of ASP3026.
METHODS: Advanced solid tumor patients received oral ASP3026 in 3 + 3 dose-escalation cohorts at doses of 25-800 mg once daily in 28-day cycles. The endpoints were to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and the pharmacokinetic profile of ASP3026. A phase Ib expansion cohort enrolled patients with metastatic, crizotinib-resistant ALK-positive solid tumors at the RP2D, and response was evaluated by RECIST 1.1.
RESULTS: The dose-escalation cohort enrolled 33 patients, including three crizotinib-resistant, ALK-positive patients, and the dose-expansion cohort enrolled another 13 crizotinib-resistant, ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. ASP3026 demonstrated both linear pharmacokinetics and dose-proportional exposure for area under the plasma concentration-time curve and maximum concentration observed with a median terminal half-life of 35 h, supporting the daily dosing. Grade 3 rash and elevated transaminase concentrations were dose-limiting toxicities observed at 800 mg; hence, 525 mg daily was the MTD and RP2D. The most common treatment-related adverse events were nausea (38\%), fatigue (35\%), and vomiting (35 \%). Among the 16 patients with crizotinib-resistant ALK-positive tumors (15 NSCLC, 1 neuroblastoma), eight patients achieved partial response (overall response rate 50\%; 95\% confidence interval 25-75\%) and seven patients (44\%) achieved stable disease.
CONCLUSIONS: ASP3026 was well tolerated and had therapeutic activity in patients with crizotinib-resistant ALK-positive advanced tumors.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rate of clearance of antileukemic agents differs by a factor of 3 to 10 among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We hypothesized that the outcome of treatment would be improved if doses were individualized to prevent low systemic exposure to the drugs in patients with fast drug clearance.
METHODS: We stratified and randomly assigned 182 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia to postremission regimens that included high-dose methotrexate and teniposide plus cytarabine. The doses of these drugs were based on body-surface area (in the conventional-therapy group) or the rates of clearance of the three medications in each patient (in the individualized-treatment group). In the individualized-treatment group, doses were increased in patients with rapid clearance and decreased in patients with very slow clearance.
RESULTS: Patients who received individualized doses had significantly fewer courses of treatment with systemic exposures below the target range than did patients who received conventional doses (P{\textless}0.001 for each medication). Among the patients with B-lineage leukemia, those who received individualized therapy had a significantly better outcome than those given conventional therapy (P=0.02); the mean (+/-SE) rates of continuous complete remission at five years were 76+/-6 percent and 66+/-7 percent, respectively. There was no significant difference between treatments for patients with T-lineage leukemia (P=0.54). In a proportional-hazards model, the time-dependent systemic exposure to methotrexate, but not to teniposide or cytarabine, was significantly related to the risk of early relapse in children with B-lineage leukemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjusting the dose of methotrexate to account for the patient's ability to clear the drug can improve the outcome in children with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia.},

The problem could be due to the late onset of unacceptable toxicities that were not observed in early-phase trials. We explore methodologies to find appropriate doses in situations where a drug meets the primary efficacy objective but concerns about toxicity remain. In this manuscript, we propose a general framework to design a good phase IV trial that is designed to optimize the treatment regimen. In the first step, we learn from the existing data about the dose-response and dose-toxicity relationships and further to explore and establish the relationship using a statistical model. Noting the limitations of the exploratory analyses, these analyses are not sufficient to allow us to make definitive conclusions. However, the prediction obtained from the model, either estimated efficacy metrics or safety parameters for some doses, can be incorporated in the design of the phase IV trial. In the second step, we further propose and compare design options, including options that could effectively incorporate information from these exploratory analyses, for clinical trials to find optimal doses, including trials to fulfill postmarketing commitments or requirements.},

	abstract = {The aim of phase I clinical trials is to obtain reliable information on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and mechanism of action of drugs with the objective of determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In most phase I studies, dose-finding and PK analysis are done separately and no attempt is made to combine them during dose allocation. In cases such as rare diseases, paediatrics, and studies in a biomarker-defined subgroup of a defined population, the available population size will limit the number of possible clinical trials that can be conducted. Combining dose-finding and PK analyses to allow better estimation of the dose-toxicity curve should then be considered. In this work, we propose, study, and compare methods to incorporate PK measures in the dose allocation process during a phase I clinical trial. These methods do this in different ways, including using PK observations as a covariate, as the dependent variable or in a hierarchical model. We conducted a large simulation study that showed that adding PK measurements as a covariate only does not improve the efficiency of dose-finding trials either in terms of the number of observed dose limiting toxicities or the probability of correct dose selection. However, incorporating PK measures does allow better estimation of the dose-toxicity curve while maintaining the performance in terms of MTD selection compared to dose-finding designs that do not incorporate PK information. In conclusion, using PK information in the dose allocation process enriches the knowledge of the dose-toxicity relationship, facilitating better dose recommendation for subsequent trials.},

	abstract = {BackgroundIn traditional Phase-I oncology trials, the safety of a new chemotherapeutic agent is tested in a dose escalation study to identify the maximum tolerated dose, which is defined as the highest dose with acceptable toxicity. An alternate approach is to jointly model toxicity and efficacy and allow dose finding to be directed by a prespecified trade-off between efficacy and toxicity. With this goal in mind, several designs have been proposed to jointly model toxicity and efficacy in a Phase I?II dose escalation study. A factor limiting the use of these designs is that toxicity and efficacy must be observed in a timely manner.PurposeOne approach to overcoming this problem is to model toxicity and efficacy as time-to-event outcomes. This would allow new subjects to be enrolled before full information is available for previous subjects while incorporating partial information when adaptively assigning new subjects to a dose level.MethodsWe propose a Phase I?II dose escalation study for evaluating toxicity and efficacy with delayed outcomes by jointly modeling toxicity and efficacy as time-to-event outcomes. We apply our proposed design to a Phase I?II clinical trial of a novel targeted toxin for canine hemangiosarcoma.ResultsOur simulation results show that our design identifies the optimal dose at a similar rate to dose finding that treats toxicity and efficacy as binary outcomes, but with substantial savings in study duration.LimitationsOur proposed design has acceptable operating characteristics and dramatically reduces the trial duration compared to a design that considers toxicity and efficacy as binary outcomes, but comes at the cost of enrolling additional subjects when all dose levels are unacceptable.ConclusionsWe developed a novel Phase I?II design that accounts for delayed outcomes by modeling toxicity and efficacy as time-to-event outcomes. Our design has similar operating characteristics to efficacy/toxicity trade-off designs that consider efficacy and toxicity as binary outcomes, but with a dramatically shorter study duration.},

	abstract = {BackgroundEmicizumab (ACE910) is a bispecific antibody mimicking the cofactor function of activated coagulation factor VIII. In phase I–I/II studies, emicizumab reduced the bleeding frequency in patients with severe hemophilia A, regardless of the presence of factor VIII inhibitors, at once-weekly subcutaneous doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg.MethodsUsing the phase I–I/II study data, population pharmacokinetic and repeated time-to-event (RTTE) modeling were performed to quantitatively characterize the relationship between the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab and reduction in bleeding frequency. Simulations were then performed to identify the minimal exposure expected to achieve zero bleeding events for 1 year in at least 50\% of patients and to select the dosing regimens to be tested in phase III studies.ResultsThe RTTE model adequately predicted the bleeding onset over time as a function of plasma emicizumab concentration. Simulations suggested that plasma emicizumab concentrations of ≥ 45 μg/mL should result in zero bleeding events for 1 year in at least 50\% of patients. This efficacious exposure provided the basis for selecting previously untested dosing regimens of 1.5 mg/kg once weekly, 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks for phase III studies.ConclusionsA pharmacometric approach guided the phase III dose selection of emicizumab in hemophilia A, without conducting a conventional dose-finding study. Phase III studies with the selected dosing regimens are currently ongoing. This case study indicates that a pharmacometric approach can substitute for a conventional dose-finding study in rare diseases and will streamline the drug development process.},

CTC nonzero at baseline and 0 at 13 weeks (CTC0); CTC conversion (≥ 5 CTCs at baseline, ≤ 4 at 13 weeks—the US Food and Drug Administration cleared response measure); a 30\%, 50\%, and 70\% decrease in CTC count; and a 30\%, 50\%, and 70\% decrease in PSA level.

The discriminatory strength of each end point with respect to overall survival in each trial was assessed using the weighted c-index.ResultsOf the eight response end points, CTC0 and CTC conversion had the highest weighted c-indices, with smaller standard deviations. For CTC0, the mean (standard deviation) was 0.81 (0.04); for CTC conversion, 0.79 (0.03); for 30\% decrease in CTC count, 0.72 (0.06); for 50\% decrease in CTC count, 0.72 (0.06); for 70\% decrease in CTC count, 0.73 (0.05); for 30\% decrease in PSA level, 0.71 (0.03); for 50\% decrease in PSA level, 0.72 (0.06); and for 70\% decrease in PSA level, 0.74 (0.05). Seventy-five percent of eligible patients could be evaluated with the CTC0 end point, compared with 51\% with the CTC conversion end point.ConclusionThe CTC0 and CTC conversion end points had the highest discriminatory power for overall survival. Both are robust and meaningful response end points for early-phase metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer clinical trials.

One factor associated with loss of response is immunogenicity, whereby the production of antidrug antibodies accelerates mAb clearance. However, other factors related to patient and disease characteristics also influence the pharmacokinetics of mAbs. These factors include gender, body size, concomitant use of immunosuppressive agents, disease type, serum albumin concentration, and the degree of systemic inflammation. Because it is important to maintain clinically effective concentrations to provide optimal clinical response and drug exposure is affected by patient factors, a better understanding of the pharmacology of mAbs will ultimately result in better patient care.},

	abstract = {The introduction of biologics, especially tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, has revolutionized the management of chronic inflammatory diseases. However, at least one third of patients with these diseases, receiving TNF inhibitors either do not respond to treatment, or lose initial responsiveness. For a significant proportion, improvement of clinical response is achieved after switching to another anti-TNF drug, suggesting a basis for failure unrelated to the therapeutic target itself. A likely explanation for this is immunogenicity, as all biologics are potentially immunogenic, and the resulting anti-drug antibodies (ADAb) can theoretically decrease the efficacy of biologics and/or induce adverse events. Indeed, in these chronic inflammatory diseases, many studies have now established correlations between ADAb formation, low serum drug levels, and the failure or loss of response to anti-TNF antibodies. This article will review key findings related to ADAb, and propose a model wherein monitoring of drug levels and ADAb may be a predictive tool leading to a better choice of biologics. Such an approach could improve chronic inflammatory disease management toward a personalized and more cost-effective approach.},

	abstract = {Currently, five anti-TNF biologic agents are approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA): adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept, golimumab and certolizumab pegol. Formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) has been associated with all five agents. In the case of adalimumab and infliximab, immunogenicity is strongly linked to subtherapeutic serum drug levels and a lack of clinical response, but for the other three agents, data on immunogenicity are scarce, suggesting that further research would be valuable. Low ADA levels might not influence the efficacy of anti-TNF therapy, whereas high ADA levels impair treatment efficacy by considerably reducing unbound drug levels. Immunogenicity is not only an issue in patients treated with anti-TNF biologic agents; the immunogenicity of other therapeutic proteins, such as factor VIII and interferons, is well known and has been investigated for many years. The results of such studies suggest that investigations to determine the optimal treatment regimen (drug dosing, treatment schedule and co-medication) required to minimize the likelihood of ADA formation might be an effective and practical way to deal with the immunogenicity of anti-TNF biologic agents for RA.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, and pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PEG-IFN) monotherapy are active against melanoma and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We explored the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of pembrolizumab combined with either ipilimumab or PEG-IFN in patients with advanced melanoma or RCC. Experimental Design: The phase 1b KEYNOTE-029 study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02089685) included independent pembrolizumab plus reduced-dose ipilimumab and pembrolizumab plus PEG-IFN cohorts. Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W plus 4 doses of ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W was tolerable if ≤6/18 patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The target DLT rate for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W plus PEG-IFN was 30\%, with a maximum of 14 patients per dose level. Response was assessed per RECIST v1.1 by central review. Results: The ipilimumab cohort enrolled 22 patients, including 19 evaluable for DLTs. Six patients experienced ≥1 DLT. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 13 (59\%) patients. Responses occurred in 5/12 (42\%) patients with melanoma and 3/10 (30\%) patients with RCC. In the PEG-IFN cohort, DLTs occurred in 2/14 (14\%) patients treated at dose level 1 (PEG-IFN 1 μg/kg/week) and 2/3 (67\%) patients treated at dose level 2 (PEG-IFN 2 μg/kg/week). Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 10/17 (59\%) patients. Responses occurred in 1/5 (20\%) patients with melanoma and 2/12 (17\%) patients with RCC. Conclusions: Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W was tolerable and provided promising antitumor activity in patients with advanced melanoma or RCC. The maximum tolerated dose of pembrolizumab plus PEG-IFN had limited antitumor activity in this population.},

	abstract = {TPS3630Background: Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that blocks several protein kinases involved in angiogenesis and oncogenesis. It was recently shown to provide a survival benefit in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Despite the observed benefits, toxicities such as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES- which occurs early in the first 1-2 weeks) and fatigue have limited its use. Multiple practices across the US adopted various dosing or interval scheduling despite the absence of supportive data. Methods: ReDOS (NCT02368886) is an Academic and Community Cancer Research United (ACCRU) network-led randomized phase II study of lower dose regorafenib compared to standard dose regorafenib in patients with refractory mCRC. Patients are randomized 1:1 to receive an escalating dose (Arm A: 80 mg daily Week 1, 120 mg daily Week 2,160 mg daily week 3 then 1 week off followed by Cycle 2) vs. standard dose (Arm B: 160 mg daily for 21 days/then 1 week off). Within each treatment arm, patients are further randomized to receive either pre-emptive or reactive Clobetasol for prevention/treatment of PPES (sub-arms A1, A2, B1 and B2). Eligibility criteria include histologically confirmed mCRC, ECOG ≤ 1, acceptable organ function, and patients must have failed all standard regimens including appropriate biologics. The primary endpoint is the 8 week planned continuation rate defined as the proportion of patients in each arm who complete 2 cycles of treatment and who intend to initiate cycle 3 if no progression is noted. Assuming an 8-week planned continuation rate of 75\% in the control group (B), and desiring an improvement to 90\% in the experimental group (A), a one-sided test with alpha = 0.20 and power of 80\% will require a sample size of 110 patients enrolled to both regorafenib arms (A and B) with 28 patients randomized to treatment sub-arm (A1, A2, B1, B2). An additional 10 patients will be enrolled to account for dropout, cancellations, ineligibles, etc, to give a total sample size of 120 patients. The total study duration is expected to be approximately 2 years. Clinical trial information: NCT02368886.},

We report 5-year follow-up results from an early phase I study of nivolumab in this patient population and describe characteristics of 5-year survivors.Patients and MethodsPatients with pretreated, advanced NSCLC received nivolumab 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks in 8-week cycles for up to 96 weeks. OS from the time of first dose was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.ResultsThe estimated 5-year OS rate was 16\% for all treated patients (N = 129); 5-year OS rates were similar for squamous (16\%) and nonsquamous (15\%) NSCLC. Of 16 5-year survivors, most (88\%) were known current or former smokers. Of 10 5-year survivors with quantifiable PD-1 ligand 1 expression, 70\% had ≥ 1\% PD-1 ligand 1 expression at baseline. Twelve 5-year survivors (75\%) achieved a partial response to nivolumab per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.0, and two each (12\%) had stable disease and progressive disease as best response. Nine 5-year survivors (56\%) completed the maximum 96 weeks of nivolumab; four (25\%) discontinued owing to adverse events and three (19\%) owing to disease progression. As of a November 2016 database lock, 12 5-year survivors (75\%) received no subsequent therapy and were without evidence of progressive disease at last follow-up.ConclusionsNivolumab treatment resulted in long-term OS and durable responses in a proportion of patients with pretreated advanced NSCLC. Long-term survivors had diverse baseline and on-treatment characteristics.},

	abstract = {Purpose:
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) catalyzes the degradation of tryptophan to N-formyl-kynurenine. Overexpressed in many solid malignancies, IDO1 can promote tumor escape from host immunosurveillance. This first-in-human phase I study investigated the maximum tolerated dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of epacadostat (INCB024360), a potent and selective inhibitor of IDO1.Experimental Design:Fifty-two patients with advanced solid malignancies were treated with epacadostat [50 mg once daily or 50, 100, 300, 400, 500, 600, or 700 mg twice daily (BID)] in a dose-escalation 3 + 3 design and evaluated in 28-day cycles. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.Results:One dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred at the dose of 300 mg BID (grade 3, radiation pneumonitis); another DLT occurred at 400 mg BID (grade 3, fatigue). The most common adverse events in {\textgreater}20\% of patients overall were fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspnea, back pain, and cough. Treatment produced significant dose-dependent reductions in plasma kynurenine levels and in the plasma kynurenine/tryptophan ratio at all doses and in all patients. Near maximal changes were observed at doses of ≥100 mg BID with {\textgreater}80\% to 90\% inhibition of IDO1 achieved throughout the dosing period. Although no objective responses were detected, stable disease lasting ≥16 weeks was observed in 7 of 52 patients.Conclusions:Epacadostat was generally well tolerated, effectively normalized kynurenine levels, and produced maximal inhibition of IDO1 activity at doses of ≥100 mg BID. Studies investigating epacadostat in combination with other immunomodulatory drugs are ongoing.Clin Cancer Res; 23(13); 3269-76. ©2017 AACR.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known about the outcomes, safety, and response to subsequent therapies of patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) treated with atezolizumab outside clinical trials.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study include to report the clinical efficacy and safety of atezolizumab, and the response to future therapies in clinical practice outside clinical trials.
PATIENT AND METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-center study including consecutive patients with confirmed mUC who received at least one dose of atezolizumab 1200 mg every 3 weeks between May 2016 and April 2017.
RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients, median age 72 years (range 29-93), 71\% men and 76\% ECOG PS 0-1, were identified. Most patients (79\%) had primary cancer in the bladder, 62\% had prior surgery, and 75\% received at least one prior line of treatment (34 patients had prior cisplatin-based chemotherapy). Best response included 18\% partial response, 29\% stable disease, and 53\% progressive disease. Patients were on atezolizumab for a median of 2.7 months (95\%CI, 1.8-3.6) and median PFS was 3.2 months (95\%CI, 1.6-4.8). A total of 33 (42\%) patients had significant (any cause) AEs, including grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia in two patients; no toxic deaths were reported. At time of data analysis, only 18\% of patients received at least one subsequent line of treatment for a median of 1.8 months (95\%CI, 0.0-5.0) while 42\% were referred to palliative care/hospice or died.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mUC who progressed on atezolizumab were unlikely to receive subsequent systemic treatments and the benefit of those treatments appeared limited in our cohort. The findings may impact timing and designs of clinical trials in mUC.},

	abstract = {Phase 1 oncology trials are critical to improving the treatment of cancer. Critics have raised 2 fundamental ethical challenges about phase 1 cancer research: the paucity of benefits with substantial risks and poor-quality informed consent. Despite 3 decades of controversy about phase 1 oncology research, there is little critical analysis of the arguments or of the data relevant to these questions. Existing but old data reveal that about 5\% of patients in phase 1 trials experience shrinkage of their tumor, with a 0.5\% mortality rate. In some notable cases, patients in phase 1 trials have been cured or sustained long-term remissions. Limited data suggest that patients in phase 1 trials may have better quality of life than comparable patients receiving supportive care. More important, the risks and benefits of phase 1 trials are not clearly worse than risk-benefit ratios used by the US Food and Drug Administration to approve chemotherapeutic agents for clinical use. The objections based on informed consent are deficiencies of disclosure, understanding, and voluntariness. The available data do not support the claim that disclosure is deficient. Although studies evaluating patient understanding have substantial methodological problems, they demonstrate that more than 70\% of patients understand that they may not directly benefit even when they hope they will personally benefit. Finally, a closer look at issues of voluntariness reveals that patients with advanced cancer who participate in phase 1 research may have a different set of values than do critics and are not coerced. Overall, it appears that phase 1 oncology trials satisfy the requirement for a favorable risk-benefit ratio and that patients who enroll provide adequate informed consent.},

Protein E2-binding activity was reversibly depressed in the presence of high salt concentrations, decreased in the presence of dithioerythritol and on heating at the temperature of over 50 degree C. The optimum E2 binding was observed at pH 7.3--7.7. There were no significant differences in the properties of protein from the liver of males and females.

An adapted Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) and Rolling 6 (R6) method, designed to avoid this suspension of accrual in pediatric oncology, are compared with the traditional 3+3 design.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The competing performances were evaluated in a simulation study integrating the temporal dimension, and a phase I trial was reanalyzed. We compared methods for various interpatient arrival times and dose-toxicity relations, in terms of distribution of final recommendations, number of skipped children and duration of trials.
RESULTS: R6 and CRM can be safely implemented to limit trial suspensions, especially when mean interpatient arrival time is short. CRM was found to be more efficient than algorithm-based methods (44\% of good recommendations vs. 38\%) but moderately increased the risk of overtreatment. The R6 design included more patients at suboptimal doses. The design with the shortest study duration depended on the number of dose to escalate before the target.
CONCLUSION: These new methods can reduce the number of skipped patients, but only provide limited gain in terms of ability to select the right dose. New designs are needed.},

As it stands, neither the CRM, nor any of the other dynamic schemes, allow for the correct estimation of some target percentile, based on retrospective data apart from the exceptional situation in which the simplified model exactly generates the observations. In this article we focus on the very specific issue of retrospective analysis of data generated by some arbitrary mechanism and subsequently analyzed via the continual reassessment method.

Many variations have been published and discussed in the statistical literature, but there has not been as much practical advice for choosing design parameters and implementing the CRM. As a result, the CRM has not been as widely utilized as it could be for dose-finding studies.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Topotecan is an established topoisomerase I inhibitor for the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer. Myelotoxicity and suboptimal patient convenience associated with daily topotecan, however, have prompted investigators to explore alternate regimens, including a weekly regimen of topotecan. The objective of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of topotecan given as a weekly bolus in previously treated ovarian cancer patients.
METHODS: Second- and third-line ovarian cancer patients with measurable disease or elevated cancer antigen 125 received weekly bolus topotecan intravenously starting at 1.5 mg/m(2). Topotecan was escalated in dose increments of 0.5 mg/m(2) every 21 days as tolerability allowed. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as grade 3/4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.
RESULTS: Thirty-two of 35 patients were evaluable for safety and tolerability. No notable toxicity was observed with weekly topotecan doses {\textless} 4 mg/m(2). Additionally, there was an absence of dose-limiting myelotoxicity and thrombocytopenia with weekly topotecan. The MTD of weekly topotecan without the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support was 4 mg/m(2), with grade 2 anemia, chronic fatigue, and grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity limiting further dose escalation. Weekly topotecan also demonstrated antitumor activity at doses {\textgreater}2 mg/m(2).
CONCLUSIONS: The establishment of a well-tolerated, weekly regimen of topotecan (4 mg/m(2), with a maximum recommended dose of 6 mg/m(2)) provides the basis for further investigation in phase II studies of single-agent and combination regimens in previously treated ovarian cancer patients.},

To study the effect of cumulative toxicity in patients, it is necessary to examine how patients respond to multiple-dose administrations. To this end, we propose a longitudinal dose-response model that accommodates this concern, which is motivated from clearance-rate considerations and from a model proposed by Simon et al.

	doi = {10.1007/s002800000228},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In a sample of NCIC CTG phase I trials we noted that studies of antimetabolites were frequently confounded by the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) at doses well below those ultimately recommended (recommended dose, RD) for further study, necessitating frequent expansion of dose levels and usually a change to more conservative dose escalation. This slowed development, exposed patients to ineffective doses of drugs, and raises concerns about the safety of current trial designs which include a single patient per dose level. Conversely, some patients treated at the RD may be receiving inadequate doses of anticancer drugs. To determine if this was a general phenomenon, we undertook a review of the results of a large group of phase I trials of cytotoxic agents.
METHODS: Starting dose (SD), number of dose levels, dose at first DLT (D-DLT), maximum tolerated doses (MTD, dose at which DLT is seen in two or more patients) and RD were extracted from the NCI-Canada phase I trial database, and from a literature survey of phase I studies published between 1985 and 1999. Combination phase I and phase Ib studies were excluded.
RESULTS: The review included 33 trials with antimetabolites and 60 with other cytotoxic agents. The median ratio D-DLT/MTD was 0.33 for antimetabolites and 0.75 for other cytotoxic agents (P {\textless} 0.01). Similarly, the median ratio D-DLT/RD was 0.43 for antimetabolites and 1 for other cytotoxic agents (P {\textless} 0.01). The median number of dose levels tested was nine for antimetabolites and six for other cytotoxic agents.
DISCUSSION: Statistically significant differences in the ratios D-DLT/MTD and D-DLT/RD between antimetabolites and other cytotoxic compounds were noted, confirming our initial observations that unpredictable DLT occurs earlier and at lower dose levels in phase I clinical trials of antimetabolites than would be expected as compared to other classes ofcytotoxic agents. Toxicity thus appears to be incompletely predicted by dose alone for antimetabolites. DLT may occur in certain patients at doses well below the RD. Current phase I design may not be ideal for development of these compounds, and should focus on pharmacodynamic endpoints in addition to traditional pharmacokinetic and clinical endpoints.},

METHODS: 525 women younger than 60 years of age with high-risk primary breast cancer were randomised after surgery to receive nine cycles of tailored FEC to haematological equitoxicity with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support (n=251), or three cycles of FEC at standard doses followed by high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin (CTCb), and peripheral-blood stem-cell or bone-marrow support (n=274). Both groups received locoregional radiation therapy and tamoxifen for 5 years. The primary outcome measure was relapse-free survival, and analysis was by intention to treat.
FINDINGS: At a median follow-up of 34.3 months, there were 81 breast-cancer relapses in the tailored FEC group versus 113 in the CTCb group (double triangular method p=0.04). 60 deaths occurred in the tailored FEC group and 82 in the CTCb group (log-rank p=0.12). Patients in the CTCb group experienced more grade 3 or 4 acute toxicity compared with the tailored FEC group (p{\textless}0.0001). Two treatment-related deaths (0.7\%) occurred in the CTCb group. Six patients in the tailored FEC group developed acute myeloid leukaemia and three developed myelodysplastic syndrome.
INTERPRETATION: Tailored FEC with G-CSF support resulted in a significantly improved relapse-free survival and fewer grade 3 and 4 toxicities compared with marrow-supported high-dose chemotherapy with CTCb as adjuvant therapy of women with high-risk primary breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, treatment regimens for cancer often involve a combination of drugs. The determination of the doses of each of the combined drugs in phase I dose escalation studies poses methodological challenges. The most common phase I design, the classic '3+3' design, has been criticized for poorly estimating the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and for treating too many subjects at doses below the MTD. In addition, the classic '3+3' is not able to address the challenges posed by combinations of drugs. Here, we assume that a control drug (commonly used and well-studied) is administered at a fixed dose in combination with a new agent (the experimental drug) of which the appropriate dose has to be determined. We propose a randomized design in which subjects are assigned to the control or to the combination of the control and experimental. The MTD is determined using a model-based Bayesian technique based on the difference of probability of dose limiting toxicities (DLT) between the control and the combination arm. We show, through a simulation study, that this approach provides better and more accurate estimates of the MTD. We argue that this approach may differentiate between an extreme high probability of DLT observed from the control and a high probability of DLT of the combination. We also report on a fictive (simulation) analysis based on published data of a phase I trial of ifosfamide combined with sunitinib.},

This can be achieved by antibodies blocking the cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway, either alone or in combination. The main premise for inducing an immune response is the preexistence of antitumor T cells that were limited by specific immune checkpoints. Most patients who have tumor responses maintain long-lasting disease control, yet one-third of patients relapse. Mechanisms of acquired resistance are currently poorly understood, but evidence points to alterations that converge on the antigen presentation and interferon-γ signaling pathways.

	doi = {10.1200/JCO.2000.18.4.927},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the maximum-tolerated dose, toxicities, and pharmacokinetic profile of the farnesyl protein transferase inhibitor R115777 when administered orally bid for 5 days every 2 weeks.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with a median age of 58 years received 85 cycles of R115777 using an intrapatient and interpatient dose escalation schema. Drug was administered orally at escalating doses as a solution (25 to 850 mg bid) or as pellet capsules (500 to 1300 mg bid). Pharmacokinetics were assessed after the first dose and the last dose administered during cycle 1.
RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 neuropathy was observed in one patient and grade 2 fatigue (decrease in two performance status levels) was seen in four of six patients treated with 1,300 mg bid. The most frequent clinical grade 2 or 3 adverse events in any cycle included nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, anemia, and hypotension. Myelosuppression was mild and infrequent. Peak plasma concentrations of R115777 were achieved within 0.5 to 4 hours after oral drug administration. The elimination of R115777 from plasma was biphasic, with sequential half-lives of about 5 hours and 16 hours. There was little drug accumulation after bid dosing, and steady-state concentrations were achieved within 2 to 3 days. The pharmacokinetics were dose proportional in the 25 to 325 mg/dose range for the oral solution. Urinary excretion of unchanged R115777 was less than 0.1\% of the oral dose. One patient with metastatic colon cancer treated at the 500-mg bid dose had a 46\% decrease in carcinoembryonic antigen levels, improvement in cough, and radiographically stable disease for 5 months.
CONCLUSION: R115777 is bioavailable after oral administration and has an acceptable toxicity profile. Based upon pharmacokinetic data, the recommended dose for phase II trials is 500 mg orally bid (total daily dose, 1, 000 mg) for 5 consecutive days followed by 9 days of rest. Studies of continuous dosing and studies of R115777 in combination with chemotherapy are ongoing.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of intrapatient dose-escalation methodology for dose-ranging studies of conventional cytotoxics in combination.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case records were identified for patients with ovarian cancer treated first-line with either single-agent carboplatin or carboplatin and paclitaxel in combination and routinely subjected to a 10\% dose escalation in carboplatin at each cycle, towards a target day-22 neutrophil count in the range 1.0-1.5x10(9)/l and a platelet count in the range 75-110x10(9)/l, defining adequate dose. 'Entry level' carboplatin doses were in the range AUC 5.1 to AUC 7.4; paclitaxel was given at 175 mg/m(2) as a 3-h infusion throughout. All drugs were administered three-weekly.
RESULTS: The distribution of carboplatin maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) indicated a wide interpatient variation, ranging from AUC 5.4 to AUC 9.8. The median MTD in those receiving carboplatin alone (AUC 6.9) was significantly lower than in those treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel (AUC 7.6) ( P=0.01). Also, paclitaxel had both neutrophil- and platelet-protective effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The median MTD documented here using intrapatient dose escalation for carboplatin combined with paclitaxel is remarkably similar to that derived from conventional phase I studies. Furthermore, the striking range of carboplatin MTDs recorded in previously untreated patients may have implications for the wider development of management strategies based on the adequacy of treatment, as defined by the modest levels of dose-limiting toxicity encountered. The ready availability of an expanded set of MTD data by this methodology may also provide more compelling evidence about potential pharmacodynamic drug interactions than may be available from conventional phase I combination studies. These retrospective findings clearly justify further prospective evaluation of intrapatient dose-escalation methodology in dose-ranging studies.},

	abstract = {Clinical trials with multiple strata are increasingly used in drug development. They may sometimes be the only option to study a new treatment, for example in small populations and rare diseases. In early phase trials, where data are often sparse, good statistical inference and subsequent decision-making can be challenging. Inferences from simple pooling or stratification are known to be inferior to hierarchical modeling methods, which build on exchangeable strata parameters and allow borrowing information across strata. However, the standard exchangeability (EX) assumption bears the risk of too much shrinkage and excessive borrowing for extreme strata. We propose the exchangeability-nonexchangeability (EXNEX) approach as a robust mixture extension of the standard EX approach. It allows each stratum-specific parameter to be exchangeable with other similar strata parameters or nonexchangeable with any of them. While EXNEX computations can be performed easily with standard Bayesian software, model specifications and prior distributions are more demanding and require a good understanding of the context. Two case studies from phases I and II (with three and four strata) show promising results for EXNEX. Data scenarios reveal tempered degrees of borrowing for extreme strata, and frequentist operating characteristics perform well for estimation (bias, mean-squared error) and testing (less type-I error inflation).},

	title = {The conduct of most first-in-human oncology drug trials is conceptually incoherent, and unethical.},
	url = {https://www.growkudos.com/publications/10.1101%252F240846},
	abstract = {When a new cancer drug is tried for the first time in cancer patients, we lack answers even to very basic questions about the drug: What range of doses can patients tolerate? What bad effects does the drug cause? These are the types of questions that we try to answer in 'Phase 1' dose-finding trials.

These dose-finding trials are most commonly run using a group-wise 'dose-escalation' design. Such trials enroll patients sequentially, and dose them in small groups called 'cohorts'—usually of 3 patients each. The first cohort gets a low dose of the drug that is expected to be quite safe, and are monitored for some period of time to see if they experience toxicities. If not, then the study dose is 'escalated', which means that a new cohort is enrolled to receive a higher dose. This process is repeated usually until moderate (but not severe) toxicities are seen. The dose where this happens is then thought to strike a reasonable balance between being too low (which might not help anyone) and too high (which causes too much harm).

This way of running a dose-finding trial treats the enrolled patients like manufactured products in destructive testing: Take 3 units of the product, and drop them from 3 ft onto a concrete floor. If they suffer minimal damage, take 3 fresh units and drop them from 4 ft. And so on, until you find the greatest height where the damage stays strictly cosmetic, and the product still works. Obviously, this manner of product testing depends on all the manufactured units being identical. (Imagine how senseless such testing would be, if it were done on a grab-bag of mobile phones of many different makes and models built to different standards of ruggedness.)

But the patients enrolled in a dose-finding study are of course not identical 'units'! In light of the differences between patients, think about that moment in a dose-escalation trial when the second cohort are enrolled at an escalated dose. At this point in time, you have a cohort of (say) 3 patients already in the study, who have been tolerating a low dose of the drug. Wouldn't they be the best candidates to try a new, higher dose of the drug—a dose that has never been tried in humans before? I think so. Nevertheless, the common practice is to enroll 3 new patients into the escalation cohort. This practice violates a principle that I introduce in this paper under the name 'precautionary coherence'. The reason for this name is simple: when trying a higher dose for the first time, caution demands this be done preferentially in willing patients who have already tolerated a lower dose, rather than drug-naive patients.

The core point of this paper is that designing a dose-finding trial in accordance with 'precautionary coherence' (PC) requires abandoning the practice of dose-escalation described above. Rather, a 'PC' dose-finding trial must use a dose-titration design, where each patient individually starts at a low dose and gradually increases to whatever dose is best for him or her. (To help me communicate this core point succinctly, I have chosen to build upon a distinction between 'escalation' and 'titration' that has sometimes appeared in the literature. But I should point out that if you read other articles on this topic, you will mainly find "intra-patient dose escalation" used to designate what I term 'titration'. For example, many Phase 1 study reports in the literature will say something like, "intra-patient dose escalation was not allowed.")

In order to lay out the paper's main argument, I take the most widely used and familiar dose-finding design in oncology—the so-called '3+3' design—and develop a 'PC' version of it. This requires me (1) to set forth rules for running a '3+3/PC' trial and then (2) to develop a way to visualize the events that happen during such a trial, and what conclusions we can draw from those events. I also (3) run computer simulations that show how a 3+3/PC trial can individualize dosing to give better outcomes for patients.},

The median progression free survival (PFS) was similar: arm A: 45 weeks; arm B: 61 weeks (P = 0.830). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the extent of residual disease and performance status were the most important prognostic factors for PFS. Fifty-two per cent of patients received dose escalations based on nadir blood counts, and 89\% of all dose adjustments were made according to protocol. Failure to achieve a significant degree of leucopenia was associated with worse progression free survival (P less than 0.001). A total of 29.4\% of patients fall into this category. The median survival was similar in both arms, i.e. 75 weeks. It is unlikely that there is any major clinical advantage to adding chlorambucil to single agent carboplatin for the management of advanced ovarian cancer, but whether used in combination or a single agent, the dose of carboplatin should be sufficient to cause at least grade I leucopenia. This may best be achieved by determining the initial dose based on renal function, and then adjusting subsequent doses according to nadir blood counts.},

In multivariate analysis with phase III trial participants as the reference group, phase I trial participants least often identified altruism as a ‘very important’ motivation for enrolling (phase I OR 0.4, 95\% CI (confidence interval) 0.2–0.8; phase II OR 0.9, 95\% CI 0.5–1.5, overall P = 0.017). Thirty-three respondents (13\%) reported being motivated primarily by altruism. In multivariate analysis, participants with poor prognoses—defined as an expected 5-year disease-free survival of ≤10\%—reported altruism as their primary motivation less often than those with better prognoses (OR 0.2, 95\% CI 0.1–0.5, P = 0.001). Altruistic motivations did not differ between adult patients and parents of pediatric participants., Limitations The data are derived from related academic medical centers in one city, and the study sample reflects limited sociodemographic diversity, thereby limiting generalizability to other settings., Conclusions Although cancer trial participants commonly report that altruism contributed to their decision to enroll, it is rarely their primary motivation for study participation. Participants in early phase trials and those with poor prognoses are least often motivated by altruism.},

Eligible patients were women aged 18 years or older who had histologically confirmed HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, evidence of tumour cell CXCR4 expression, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and who had previously received between one and three chemotherapy regimens for metastatic breast cancer, and at least one endocrine therapy if they had hormone receptor-positive disease, unless they were considered unsuitable for endocrine therapy. A standard 3+3 dose-escalation design was used, followed by an expanded cohort at the established maximum tolerated dose or highest dose if no dose-limiting toxicity was observed for the combination. After a treatment-related fatal adverse event in the first cohort who received 21-day cycles of treatment with eribulin and balixafortide, a protocol amendment modified the study design to be done in two parts. Patients enrolled to part 1 received an initial 28-day run-in cycle, with some cohorts receiving de-escalated doses of eribulin plus balixafortide to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of the combination. The evaluation of part 1 did not confirm any dose-limiting toxicities or eribulin–balixafortide interactions, and therefore part 2 started enrolling patients to receive eribulin at the originally planned dose of 1·4 mg/m$^{\textrm{2}}$ on days 2 and 9 of a 21-day cycle and balixafortide from a starting dose of 2 mg/kg with dose increments of 0·5 or 1 mg/kg on days 1–3 and 8–10 of the 21-day cycle. Both drugs were administered as intravenous infusions. All patients were to receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicities and adverse events, and the establishment of a maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase 2 dose, and pharmacokinetic parameters. Safety analysis was done in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.

Professor Zimmer was a cancer patient who participated in the phase I clinical trial program at the University of Chicago. His ideas are eloquently expressed and have had a profound effect on our investigational research for anticancer agents. Although at times his suggestions may seem radical, Professor Zimmer urges us to reconsider the 50-year-old Nuremberg paradigm that participants in human research are ignorant and vulnerable and must be protected. Although we must protect patients who have life-threatening diseases from coercive inducements and misplaced hopes, we must also listen carefully and thoughtfully to our patients. This is particularly true when, as research participants in the face of sacrifice and the threat of a life-ending diagnosis, they have made the effort to express their concerns. With the effect of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome movement on clinical studies and on drug research and development, a precedent has been set that allows patients to reshape their role as participants in research trials. On a personal level, the essay by Professor Zimmer has had a significant effect on our research methods and, indeed, the focus of our research efforts. Thus, it is with a sense of respect and honor that we share George Zimmer's thoughts and our comments about the influence he has had on our research practices.},

Although responses to TRK inhibition can be dramatic and durable, duration of response may eventually be limited by acquired resistance. LOXO-195 is a selective TRK TKI designed to overcome acquired resistance mediated by recurrent kinase domain (solvent front and xDFG) mutations identified in multiple patients who have developed resistance to TRK TKIs. Activity against these acquired mutations was confirmed in enzyme and cell-based assays and in vivo tumor models. As clinical proof of concept, the first 2 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers who developed acquired resistance mutations on larotrectinib were treated with LOXO-195 on a first-in-human basis, utilizing rapid dose titration guided by pharmacokinetic assessments. This approach led to rapid tumor responses and extended the overall duration of disease control achieved with TRK inhibition in both patients.Significance: LOXO-195 abrogated resistance in TRK fusion-positive cancers that acquired kinase domain mutations, a shared liability with all existing TRK TKIs. This establishes a role for sequential treatment by demonstrating continued TRK dependence and validates a paradigm for the accelerated development of next-generation inhibitors against validated oncogenic targets.

	volume = {292},
	issn = {1538-3598},
	doi = {10.1001/jama.292.17.2130},
	abstract = {CONTEXT: In the past, cancer patients entering phase 1 studies confronted the prospects of high risk and unlikely benefit. Over the last decade, cancer drugs under development have become more targeted, and the clinical research environment has become more scrutinized. The impact of these changes on the risks and benefits to patients who participate in phase 1 cancer trials is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in the rates of treatment-related (toxic) death, objective response, and serious toxicity and to identify factors associated with these outcomes.
DATA SOURCES: We searched abstracts and journal articles reporting the results of phase 1 cancer treatment trials originally submitted to annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) from 1991 through 2002.
STUDY SELECTION: We focused on published single-agent trials that enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors and excluded studies testing agents already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration at the time of the ASCO presentation.
DATA EXTRACTION: Multiple observers independently extracted information on trial design, location, sponsorship, types of tumors treated, drug class, route of administration, and clinical outcomes.
DATA SYNTHESIS: The overall toxic death rate for 213 studies (involving 6474 cancer patients) published in peer-reviewed journals was 0.54\%, while the overall objective response rate was 3.8\%. Toxic death rates decreased over the study period, from 1.1\% over the first 4 years of the study (1991-1994) to 0.06\% over the most recent 4-year period (1999-2002) (P{\textless}.01). Response rates also decreased but by proportionally much less. After adjusting for characteristics of the experimental trials and the investigational agents, the odds of a patient dying from an experimental treatment while participating in a trial submitted during the most recent 4-year period were less than one tenth those of a patient participating in a trial submitted during the first 4-year period (odds ratio, 0.09; 95\% confidence interval, 0.01-0.67; P = .009). In comparison, the adjusted odds of a patient experiencing an objective response over the same time periods decreased by approximately half (odds ratio, 0.46; 95\% confidence interval, 0.32-0.66; P{\textless}.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The level of risk experienced by cancer patients who participate in phase 1 treatment trials appears to have improved over the 12-year period from 1991 through 2002. Because toxic death rates have decreased more quickly than have objective response rates, the ratio of risk to benefit may have also improved. These changes relate in part to the targeted and less-toxic nature of newer cancer drugs and are coincident with the increased attention that has been paid to the safety of clinical research over the time period we analyzed.},

	abstract = {The purpose of early stage clinical trials is to determine the recommended dose and toxicity profile of an investigational agent or multi-drug combination. Molecularly targeted agents (MTAs) and immunotherapies have distinct toxicities from chemotherapies that are often not dose dependent and can lead to chronic and sometimes unpredictable side effects. Therefore utilizing a dose escalation method that has toxicity based endpoints may not be as appropriate for determination of recommended dose, and alternative parameters such as pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic outcomes are potentially appealing options. Approaches to enhance safety and optimize dosing include improved preclinical models and assessment, innovative model based design and dose escalation strategies, patient selection, the use of expansion cohorts and extended toxicity assessments. Tailoring the design of phase I trials by adopting new strategies to address the different properties of MTAs is required to enhance the development of these agents. This review will focus on the limitations to safety and dose determination that have occurred in the development of MTAs and immunotherapies. In addition, strategies are proposed to overcome these challenges to develop phase I trials that can more accurately define the recommended dose and identify adverse events.},

Of note is that no drug has made it to the market which has not had a response in phase I trials. Responses were noted in very diverse histologic types of tumors. Although there were responses at doses which were as low as 3-5\% of the recommended dose for phase II trials, the majority of responses did occur at 80-120\% of the dose recommended for phase II trials. Although the response rate in phase I trials is indeed low, responses do occur. This response rate information should help the clinician provide facts for the patient considering a phase I trial with new anticancer agents. These findings also emphasize that although phase I trials are characteristically dose-finding studies, if no responses are noted in phase I studies, it is unlikely the drug will be used routinely in the clinic.},

	abstract = {Purpose Recent research has found unrealistic optimism (UO) among patient-subjects in early-phase oncology trials. Our aim was to investigate the cognitive and motivational factors that evoke this bias in this context. We expected perceptions of control to be a strong correlate of unrealistic optimism.
Methods A study of patient-subjects enrolled in early-phase oncology trials was conducted at two sites in the USA. Respondents completed questionnaires designed to assess unrealistic optimism and several risk attribute variables that have been found to evoke the bias in other contexts.
Results One hundred and seventy-one patient-subjects agreed to be interviewed for our study. Significant levels of perceived controllability were found with respect to all nine research-related questions. Perceptions of control were found to predict unrealistic optimism. Two other risk attribute variables, awareness of indicators (p=0.024) and mental image (p=0.022), were correlated with unrealistic optimism. However, in multivariate regression analysis, awareness and mental image dropped out of the model and perceived controllability was the only factor independently associated with unrealistic optimism (p{\textless}0.0001).
Conclusion Patient-subjects reported that they can, at least partially, control the benefits they receive from participating in an early-phase oncology trial. This sense of control may underlie unrealistic optimism about benefiting personally from trial participation. Effective interventions to counteract unrealistic optimism may need to address the psychological factors that give rise to distorted risk/benefit processing.},

The purpose of these proposals has been to address ethical concerns about treating excessive numbers of patients at subtherapeutic doses of a new agent and to increase the overall efficiency of the process while enhancing the precision of the recommended phase II dose. In early 1998, a workshop of phase I investigators was held under the sponsorship of Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute (Wallingford, CT) to review the experience to date with novel phase I methodologies, with a particular focus on their efficiency and safety. This report summarizes the material presented. It was concluded that for phase I trials of antineoplastics (cytotoxics), which begin at 0.1 mouse-equivalent LD10 doses, evidence to date suggests that the historic approach of using a modified Fibonacci escalation and three patients per dose level is not necessary and is seldom used. One patient per dose level and more rapid escalation schemes, both empirically based and statistically based, are commonly used with apparent safety. There remain questions, however: Which of the dose escalation schemes is optimal? Are there alternatives to toxicity as a phase I end point, and will these end points be reliable in defining active doses? Answering these questions in a reasonable time frame will be important if new anticancer agents are not to suffer undue delays in phase I evaluation.},

	doi = {10.1177/1740774514529848},
	abstract = {Background Traditionally, the purpose of a dose-finding design in cancer is to find the maximum tolerated dose based solely on toxicity. However, for molecularly targeted agents, little toxicity may arise within the therapeutic dose range and the dose-response curves may not be monotonic. This challenges the principle that more is better, which is widely accepted for conventional chemotherapy. Methods We propose three adaptive dose-finding designs for trials evaluating molecularly targeted agents, for which the dose-response curves are unimodal or plateaued. The goal of these designs is to find the optimal biological dose, which is defined as the lowest dose with the highest rate of efficacy while safe. The first proposed design is parametric and assumes a logistic dose-efficacy curve for dose finding, the second design is nonparametric and uses the isotonic regression to identify the optimal biological dose, and the third design has the spirit of a 'semiparametric' approach by assuming a logistic model only locally around the current dose. Results We conducted extensive simulation studies to investigate the operating characteristics of the proposed designs. Simulation studies show that the nonparametric and semiparametric designs have good operating characteristics for finding the optimal biological dose. Limitations The proposed designs assume a binary endpoint. Extension of the proposed designs to ordinal and time-to-event endpoints is worth further investigation. Conclusion Among the three proposed designs, the nonparametric and semiparametric designs yield consistently good operating characteristics and thus are recommended for practical use.

	doi = {10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1238},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are targeted anticancer agents with a well-documented ability to act synergistically with cytotoxic agents. We recently showed that the HDACi valproic acid sensitizes osteosarcoma cells to doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo. As there are no published reports on the clinical utility of HDACi in dogs with spontaneous cancers, we sought to determine a safe and biologically effective dose of valproic acid administered prior to a standard dose of doxorubicin.
METHODS: Twenty-one dogs were enrolled into eight cohorts in an accelerated dose-escalation trial consisting of pretreatment with oral valproic acid followed by doxorubicin on a three-week cycle. Blood and tumor tissue were collected for determination of serum valproic acid concentration and evaluation of pharmacodynamic effects by immunofluorescence cytochemistry and immunohistochemistry. Serum and complete blood counts were obtained for determination of changes in doxorubicin pharmacokinetics or hematologic effects.
RESULTS: All doses of valproic acid were well tolerated. Serum valproic acid concentrations increased linearly with dose. Doxorubicin pharmacokinetics were comparable with those in dogs receiving doxorubicin alone. A positive correlation was detected between valproic acid dose and histone hyperacetylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. No potentiation of doxorubicin-induced myelosuppression was observed. Histone hyperacetylation was documented in tumor and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Responses included 2 of 21 complete, 3 of 21 partial, 5 of 21 stable disease, and 11 of 21 progressive disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Valproic acid can be administered to dogs at doses up to 240 mg/kg/day prior to a standard dose of doxorubicin. In addition, we have developed the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic tools necessary for future studies of novel HDACi in the clinical setting of canine cancer.},

	doi = {10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1262},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: The premise for phase I trials for cytostatic agents is different from that of cytotoxic agents. For cytostatic agents, toxicity and efficacy do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing dose levels, but likely plateau after they reach maximal toxicity or efficacy. Here, we propose a phase I-II trial design to assess both toxicity and efficacy to find the best dose as well as a good dose.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We propose a 2-step dose-finding trial for assessing both toxicity and efficacy for a targeted agent. The 1st step uses a traditional phase I trial design. This step only assesses toxicity and finds the maximal tolerated dose (MTD). For the 2nd step, we propose a modified phase II selection design for 2 or 3 dose levels at and below the MTD to determine efficacy and evaluate each dose level by both efficacy and toxicity.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Simulation studies are done on several combinations of toxicity and efficacy scenarios to assess the operating statistics of our proposed trial design. We then compare our results with a traditional phase I trial followed by a single-arm phase II trial using the same total sample size. The proposed design does better in most cases than a traditional design using the same overall sample size. This design allows assessing a few dose levels more closely for both efficacy and toxicity and provides greater certainty of having correctly determined the best dose level before launching into a large efficacy trial.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The outcomes of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated in phase I clinical trials have not been systematically analyzed.
METHODS: We reviewed the records of consecutive patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC who were treated in the Phase I Clinical Trials Program at MD Anderson from August 2004 to May 2009.
RESULTS: Eighty-five patients (51 men, 34 women) treated on various phase I protocols were identified. The median age was 62 years (range, 30-85). The median number of previous systemic therapies was two (range, 0-5). A partial response was observed in eight patients (9.5\%) and stable disease lasting {\textgreater}4 months was observed in 16 patients (19\%). The median overall survival time was 10.6 months and median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 2.8 months, which was 0.6 months shorter than the median PFS of 3.4 months following prior second-line therapy. Factors predicting longer survival in the univariate analysis were an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) score of 0-1, no prior smoking, two or fewer organ systems involved, a hemoglobin level ≥ 12 g/dL, liver metastases, a history of thromboembolism, and a platelets count {\textgreater} 440 × 10(9)/L. In the multivariate analysis, a PS score of 0-1 and history negative for smoking predicted longer survival. Sixty-two (73\%) patients had grade ≤ 2 toxicity, and there were no treatment-related deaths.
CONCLUSION: Phase I clinical trials were well tolerated by selected patients with advanced NSCLC treated at M.D. Anderson. Nonsmokers and patients with a good PS survived longer. PFS in our population was shorter in smokers/ex-smokers and patients with a PS score of 2. It is reasonable to refer pretreated patients with a good PS to phase I clinical trials.},

METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 155 consecutive patients who had one or more research biopsies as part of a phase I trial from September 2004 to October 2009.
RESULTS: Of 281 research biopsies performed, 118 were paired before and after treatment biopsies (total = 236 biopsies). The most common sites of biopsy were superficial lymph node (19.9\%), followed by liver (16.4\%), and then soft tissue (15.7\%). Ultrasound-guided biopsies were the most frequent type (53.7\%). Among 142 patients who consented for mandatory biopsy, 86.6\% had the biopsy performed, compared with 4.4\% of 911 patients offered a biopsy on an optional basis (p {\textless} .0001). Biopsy was obtained most frequently on industry-sponsored trials; lack of funding on nonindustry trials was the most common reason that biopsies were not obtained. Of 281 single biopsies, only 4 (1.4\%) had complications: pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement (n = 2), infection requiring admission (n = 1), and arrhythmia with hypotension (n = 1). All but one biopsy was successful in obtaining tissue. No deaths were attributable to biopsy.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is a VEGF receptor that is widely expressed in normal tissues and is involved in tumour angiogenesis. MNRP1685A is a rodent and primate cross-binding human monoclonal antibody against NRP1 that exhibits inhibition of tumour growth in NPR1-expressing preclinical models. However, widespread NRP1 expression in normal tissues may affect MNRP1685A tumour uptake. The objective of this study was to assess MNRP1685A biodistribution in tumour-bearing mice to understand the relationships between dose, non-tumour tissue uptake and tumour uptake.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Non-tumour-bearing mice were given unlabelled MNRP1685A at 10 mg·kg(-1) . Tumour-bearing mice were given (111) In-labelled MNRP1685A along with increasing amounts of unlabelled antibody. Blood and tissues were collected from all animals to determine drug concentration (unlabelled) or radioactivity level (radiolabelled). Some animals were imaged using single photon emission computed tomography - X-ray computed tomography.
KEY RESULTS: MNRP1685A displayed faster serum clearance than pertuzumab, indicating that target binding affected MNRP1685A clearance. I.v. administration of (111) In-labelled MNRP1685A to tumour-bearing mice yielded minimal radioactivity in the plasma and tumour, but high levels in the lungs and liver. Co-administration of unlabelled MNRP1685A with the radiolabelled antibody was able to competitively block lungs and liver radioactivity uptake in a dose-dependent manner while augmenting plasma and tumour radioactivity levels.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results indicate that saturation of non-tumour tissue uptake is required in order to achieve tumour uptake and acceptable exposure to antibody. Utilization of a rodent and primate cross-binding antibody allows for translation of these results to clinical settings.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To characterize exposure-response relationships of AMG 386 in a phase 2 study in advanced ovarian cancer for the facilitation of dose selection in future studies.
METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic model of AMG 386 (N = 141) was developed and applied in an exposure-response analysis using data from patients (N = 160) with recurrent ovarian cancer who received paclitaxel plus AMG 386 (3 or 10 mg/kg once weekly) or placebo. Reduction in the risk of progression or death with increasing exposure (steady-state area under the concentration-versus-time curve [AUC(ss)]) was assessed using Cox regression analyses. Confounding factors were tested in multivariate analysis. Alternative AMG 386 doses were explored with Monte Carlo simulations using population pharmacokinetic and parametric survival models.
RESULTS: There was a trend toward increased PFS with increased AUC(ss) (hazard ratio [HR] for each one-unit increment in AUC(ss), 0.97; P = 0.097), suggesting that the maximum effect on prolonging PFS was not achieved at the highest dose tested (10 mg/kg). Among patients with AUC(ss) ≥ 9.6 mg h/mL, PFS was 8.1 months versus 5.7 months for AUC(ss) {\textless} 9.6 mg h/mL and 4.6 months for placebo. No relationship between AUC(ss) and grade ≥ 3 adverse events was observed. Simulations predicted that AMG 386 15 mg/kg once weekly would result in an AUC(ss) ≥ 9.6 mg h/mL in {\textgreater} 90\% of patients with median PFS of 8.2 months versus 5.0 months for placebo (HR [15 mg/kg vs. placebo], 0.56).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased exposure to AMG 386 was associated with improved clinical outcomes in recurrent ovarian cancer, supporting the evaluation of a higher dose in future studies.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: An analysis of database records of 1181 consecutive patients with advanced cancer who were treated in the phase I program starting 1 January 2006 was carried out.
RESULTS: All patients were treated on at least 1 of the 82 phase I clinical trials. Overall, 56 trials (68.3\%) had only targeted agents, 13 (15.9\%) only cytotoxics, and 13 (15.9\%) targeted and cytotoxic agents. Rates of grade 3 and 4 toxicity that were at least possibly drug related were 7.1\% and 3.2\%, respectively, and 5 of the 1181 patients (0.4\%) died from toxicity that was at least possibly drug related. The most common grade 3 or more toxic effects were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, dehydration, infection, altered mental status, bleeding, vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status greater than zero and use of a cytotoxic agent were selected as independent factors associated with serious toxicity.
CONCLUSION: Phase I trials of primarily targeted agents showed low rates of toxicity, with 10.3\% of patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 toxicity and a 0.4\% rate of death, at least possibly drug related.},

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Medical records of 1,181 consecutive patients who were treated on at least one trial in the phase I clinic were reviewed.
RESULTS: The median age was 58 years and 50\% were women. The median number of prior therapies was four and median survival 10 months [95\% confidence interval (CI), 9.1-10.9 months]. Independent factors that predicted shorter survival in a multivariate Cox model and could be internally validated included RMH score of {\textgreater}1 (P {\textless} 0.0001; albumin {\textless}3.5 g/dL; lactate dehydrogenase {\textgreater}upper limit of normal, and {\textgreater}two sites of metastases), gastrointestinal tumor type (P {\textless} 0.0001), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥ 1 (P = 0.0004).

The rapid development of resistance to these therapies impedes the successful management of advanced cancer. Due to the redundancy in angiogenic signaling, alternative proangiogenic factors are activated upon treatment with anti-VEGF agents. Higher doses of the agents lead to greater stimulation of compensatory proangiogenic pathways that limit the therapeutic efficacy of VEGF-targeted drugs and produce escape mechanisms for tumor. Evidence suggests that dose intensity and schedules affect the dynamics of the development of this resistance. Thus, an optimal dosing regimen is crucial to maximizing the therapeutic benefit of antiangiogenic agents and limiting treatment resistance. A systems pharmacology approach using multiscale computational modeling can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of these dynamics of angiogenic biomarkers and their impacts on tumor reduction and resistance. Herein, we discuss a systems pharmacology approach integrating the biology of VEGF-targeted therapy resistance, including circulating biomarkers, and pharmacodynamics to enable the optimization of antiangiogenic therapy for therapeutic gains.},

METHODS: A Scopus search identified 66 FIM studies that enrolled at least one patient with advanced pancreatic cancer between 2002-2012. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize categorical variables. We also screened CRKL amplifications in the FoundationOne™ pancreatic cancer database.
RESULTS: Most FIM studies included targeted therapies (76 vs. 24\%). The most common targeted therapy involved cell cycle inhibitors (24\%). Pharmacodynamic analyses were more frequently done in trials with targeted therapies (70 vs. 31\%, p=0.006). Response rates were similar. Treatment-related death was 0.5\%. Skin, cardiovascular and metabolic grade 3-4 toxicities were more frequent with targeted therapies. Four exceptional responses were identified including a complete response to bosutinib (Src Inhibitor) and partial responses to trametinib (MEK inhibitor) (2 patients) and CHR-3996 (histone deacetylase inhibitor). We found that CRKL amplifications, a potential biomarker for Src inhibitors, are present in 1\% of PDA.
CONCLUSIONS: We retrospectively identified extraordinary responses among patients with advanced PDA enrolled in FIM studies with Src, HDAC and MEK inhibitors. We identified CRKL amplifications are present in 1\% of PDA and need to be evaluated as predictive biomarker for Src inhibitors.},

We investigated the potential utility of longitudinal relative dose intensity (RDI) that may be a better new way of determining a more accurate RP2D as a lower dose that is presumably more tolerable over the long term without compromising efficacy. All consecutive patients who were initially treated using a single MTA at the conventional RP2D or at one level lower dose (OLLD) of that RP2D in 9 phase 1 trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute were included. The associations between longitudinal RDI, time to first progression, and response rate were analyzed. The RDI of the conventional RP2D group were maintained a rate of ≥70\% throughout 10 cycles, and were higher than those of the OLLD group, although in both groups the RDI gradually decreased with additional treatment cycles. The RP2D group was similar to the OLLD group with respect to time to first progression and response rate. In both groups, however, the decreasing RDI over time was significantly associated with shorter time to first disease progression; therefore, the longitudinal RDI, which takes into account lower grade toxicity occurrences, may be useful in determining a more desirable dose to use in phase 2 and 3 studies.},

	abstract = {MET tyrosine kinase (TK) dysregulation is significantly implicated in many types of cancer. Despite over 20 years of drug development to target MET in cancers, a pure anti-MET therapeutic has not yet received market approval. The failure of two recently concluded phase III trials point to a major weakness in biomarker strategies to identify patients who will benefit most from MET therapies. The capability to interrogate oncogenic mutations in MET via circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) provides an important advancement in identification and stratification of patients for MET therapy. However, a wide range in type and frequency of these mutations suggest there is a need to carefully link these mutations to MET dysregulation, at least in proof-of-concept studies. In this review, we elaborate how we can utilize recently developed and validated pharmacodynamic biomarkers of MET not only to show target engagement, but more importantly to quantitatively measure MET dysregulation in tumor tissues. The MET assay endpoints provide evidence of both canonical and non-canonical MET signaling, can be used as "effect markers" to define biologically effective doses (BEDs) for molecularly targeted drugs, confirm mechanism-of-action in testing combination of drugs, and establish whether a diagnostic test is reporting MET dysregulation. We have established standard operating procedures for tumor biopsy collections to control pre-analytical variables that have produced valid results in proof-of-concept studies. The reagents and procedures are made available to the research community for potential implementation on multiple platforms such as ELISA, quantitative immunofluorescence assay (qIFA), and immuno-MRM assays.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To better inform clinical practice, this study was aimed at capturing patients' motivations for enrolling in phase 1 trials and at quantifying their expectations of the benefits, risks, and commitment associated with clinical trials and the impact of the initial consultation on their expectations.
METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, quantitative study of newly referred adult patients considering their first phase 1 oncology trial. Participants completed questionnaires before they were seen and an abbreviated follow-up version after their consultation.
RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 396 (99\%) and 301 (76\%) before and after the clinic, respectively. Participants ranked the possibility of tumor shrinkage (84\%) as the most important motivation for considering a phase 1 trial; this was followed by no alternative treatments (56\%), their physician's recommendation (44\%), and the fact that the research might benefit others (38\%). When they were asked about the potential personal benefit, 43\% predicted tumor shrinkage initially. After the consultation, this increased to 47\%. Fourteen percent of patients expected a cure. When asked about risks, 71\% of the participants expected moderate side effects. When asked about expectations of time commitments, a majority of patients did not anticipate weekly visits, although this was understood by 93\% of patients after the consultation. Overall, patients were keen to consider trials and when asked before and after the consultation 72\% and 84\% were willing to enroll in studies, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reports that more than 80\% of patients enroll in early-phase clinical oncology trials motivated by the potential of a clinical benefit, with approximately half expecting tumor shrinkage and approximately a tenth anticipating a cure. The typical phase 1 response rate is 4\% to 20\%, and this discrepancy exemplifies the challenges faced by patients and healthcare professionals during their interactions for phase 1 studies.

	abstract = {Exciting recent advancements in deep-sequencing technology have enabled a rapid and cost-effective molecular characterization of patient-derived tumor samples. Incorporating these innovative diagnostic technologies into early clinical trials could significantly propel implementation of precision medicine by identifying genetic markers predictive of sensitivity to agents. It may also markedly accelerate drug development and subsequent regulatory approval of novel agents. Particularly noteworthy, a high-response rate in a Phase II trial involving a biomarker-enriched patient cohort could result in a regulatory treatment approval in rare histologies, which otherwise would not be a candidate for a large randomized clinical trial. Furthermore, even if a trial does not meet its statistical endpoint, tumors from a few responders should be molecularly characterized as part of the new biomarker-mining processes. In order to accommodate patient screening and accelerate the accrual process, institutions conducting early clinical trials need to be a part of a multi-institution clinical trials network. Future clinical trial design will incorporate new biomarkers discovered by a 'phenotype-to-genotype' effort with an appropriate statistical design. To help advance such changes, the National Cancer Institute has recently reformed the existing early phase clinical trials network. A new clinical trial network, the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ET-CTN), was begun and, in addition to its pre-existing infrastructure, an up-to-date clinical trial registration system, clinical trial monitoring system including electronic database and a central Institutional Review Board were formed. Ultimately, these reforms support identifying the most appropriate therapy for each tumor type by incorporating state-of-the-art molecular diagnostic tools into early clinical trials.},

Patient populations are more precisely defined and pose a challenge to the efficient inclusion of study patients. Objectives shift from the definition of a maximum tolerated dose to the evaluation of a recommended phase 2 dose. Other challenges related to the efficacy and safety profile of novel targeted anti-cancer drugs call for changes in designing first-in-human studies, such as definitions of biological doses, collection of fresh tumor tissue for surrogate marker analyses, and the management of infusion-related reactions with monoclonal antibodies. Consequently, the conduct of phase 1 clinical trials in oncology requires changes. Corresponding education with particular focus on phase 1 trials and on the complex drug development process needs to be an integrated part of the medical oncology curriculum for physicians and nursing staff.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient selection for phase I trials (PIT) in oncology is challenging. A typical inclusion criterion for PIT is 'life expectancy {\textgreater} 3 months', however the 90 day mortality (90DM) and overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced solid malignancies are difficult to predict.
METHODS: We analyzed 233 patients who were enrolled in PIT at Princess Margaret Hospital. We assessed the relationship between 17 clinical characteristics and 90DM using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to create a risk score (PMHI). We also applied the Royal Marsden Hospital risk score (RMI), which consists of 3 markers (albumin {\textless} 35g/L, {\textgreater} 2 metastatic sites, LDH {\textgreater} ULN).
RESULTS: Median age was 57 years (range 21-88). The 90DM rate was 14\%; median OS was 320 days. Predictors of 90DM were albumin {\textless} 35g/L (OR = 8.2, p = 0.01), {\textgreater} 2 metastatic sites (OR = 2.6, p = 0.02), and ECOG {\textgreater} 0 (OR = 6.3, p = 0.001); all 3 factors constitute the PMHI. To predict 90DM, the PMHI performed better than the RMI (AUC = 0.78 vs 0.69). To predict OS, the RMI performed slightly better (RMI ≥ 2, HR = 2.2, p = 0.002 vs PMHI ≥ 2, HR = 1.6, p = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: To predict 90DM, the PMHI is helpful. To predict OS, risk models should include ECOG {\textgreater} 0, {\textgreater} 2 metastatic sites, and LDH {\textgreater} ULN. Prospective validation of the PMHI is warranted.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0016633},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Phase 1 trials play a crucial role in oncology by translating laboratory science into efficient therapies. Molecular targeted agents (MTA) differ from traditional cytotoxics in terms of both efficacy and toxicity profiles. Recent reports suggest that higher doses are not essential to produce the optimal anti-tumor effect. This study aimed to assess if MTA could achieve clinical benefit at much lower dose than traditional cytotoxics in dose seeking phase 1 trials.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed 317 recent phase 1 oncology trials reported in the literature between January 1997 and January 2009. First sign of efficacy, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and their associated dose level were recorded in each trial.
RESULTS: Trials investigating conventional cytotoxics alone, MTA alone and combination of both represented respectively 63.0\% (201/317), 23.3\% (74/317) and 13.7\% (42/317) of all trials. The MTD was reached in 65.9\% (209/317) of all trials and was mostly observed at the fifth dose level. First sign of efficacy was less frequently observed at the first three dose-levels for MTA as compared to conventional cytotoxics or combinations regimens (48.3\% versus 63.2\% and 61.3\%). Sign of efficacy was observed in the same proportion whatever the treatment type (73-82\%). MTD was less frequently established in trials investigating MTA alone (51.3\%) or combinations (42.8\%) as compared to conventional cytotoxic agents (75.6\%).
CONCLUSION: First sign of efficacy was less frequently reported at the early dose-levels and MTD was less frequently reached in trials investigating molecular targeted therapy alone. Similar proportion of trials reported clinical benefit.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although aggressive dose escalation strategies were designed to improve the risk-benefit profile of phase 1 oncology trials, they have not been adequately studied. The prevalence of several novel trial designs and their association with a variety of clinical endpoints was evaluated.
METHODS: A review of the literature was performed to identify phase 1 oncology studies of cytotoxic agents published from 2002 through 2004.
RESULTS: Of 955 phase 1 oncology articles initially identified, 149 studies, comprising 4532 patients, were analyzed. Only 34\% of studies utilized aggressive dose escalation schemes, 22\% permitted intrapatient dose escalation, and only 28\% enrolled fewer than 3 patients to any dose level. Studies that allowed intrapatient dose escalation or used fewer than 3 patients per dose were not associated with different rates of response or toxicity, nor did they increase the number of patients who received the recommended phase 2 dose. However, aggressive dose escalations were associated with increased rates of both hematologic (17\% vs 10\%) and nonhematologic (17\% vs 13\%) toxicity with similar response rates. Only studies that used conservative dose escalation designs and those that studied U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents required fewer patients to complete a trial. Trials of FDA-approved agents were also associated with higher response rates than trials of non-FDA-approved agents (10\% vs 2\%), without an increased risk of toxicity.
CONCLUSIONS: Several novel aggressive design strategies intended to improve the risk-benefit profile of phase 1 oncology trials are not associated with improved clinical outcome, and may be harmful in certain instances.},

	abstract = {Background: Many research subjects believe incorrectly that the primary purpose of clinical trials is to benefit the participants rather than to improve therapy for future patients. However, few data are available about how physicians view trials. Methods: We mailed surveys to a stratified random sample (n = 1120) of U.S. medical, pediatric, and other oncology specialists who were selected from the American Society of Clinical Oncology Membership Directory. Respondents were asked to select, from a list of options, their reasons for enrolling individual patients in trials and what they thought the main societal purposes of clinical trials are. We used logistic regression models to evaluate which demographic and clinical practice characteristics were associated with responses to these questions. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Of the 547 physicians (48.8\%) who responded, 40.5\% of the medical oncologists, 32.3\% of the pediatric oncologists, and 62.6\% of the other oncology subspecialists reported enrolling individual patients in clinical trials to improve future therapy. Most of the other respondents reported enrolling patients to ensure that they received state-of-the-art treatment. When asked about the main societal purpose of clinical trials, 72.7\% of the medical oncologists, 59.4\% of the pediatric oncologists, and 81.9\% of the other oncology subspecialists cited improving future therapy; most of the other respondents cited ensuring state-of-the-art treatment for participants. In multivariable analysis, medical oncologists (odds ratio [OR] = 0.6, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.3 to 0.9) and pediatric oncologists (OR = 0.3, 95\% CI = 0.2 to 0.5) were less likely than other oncologists to identify improving future therapy as the main societal purpose of clinical trials, whereas industry physicians (OR = 4.6, 95\% CI = 1.1 to 20.5) chose this option more often than physicians who did not work for industry. Conclusions: Many respondents viewed the main societal purpose of clinical trials as benefiting the participants rather than as creating generalizable knowledge to advance future therapy. This view, which was more prevalent among specialists such as pediatric oncologists that enrolled greater proportions of patients in trials, conflicts with established principles of research ethics.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Retrospective studies have shown immune-related adverse events (irAEs) to be associated with better prognosis. However, no prospective clinical trials have been conducted, and little is known regarding the association between irAEs and the outcome of patients with NSCLC after treatment with immunotherapy.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients with advanced NSCLC who were treated with nivolumab between January and December 2016. The association between clinical outcome and irAEs 2 to 6 weeks after commencement of nivolumab treatment was investigated. IrAEs were assessed by at least three independent medical professionals.
RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were enrolled, including 19 patients with irAEs 2 weeks after commencement of nivolumab treatment. Common irAEs included rash, pyrexia, and diarrhea. Programmed cell death ligand 1-positive tumor cell expression was not significantly different between patients with and without irAEs. The objective response and disease control rates were higher in patients with irAEs than in those without irAEs (37\% versus 17\% and 74\% versus 29\% [p = 0.17 and p {\textless} 0.01], respectively]). Patients with irAEs were associated with a significantly longer median progression-free survival than those without (6.4 months [95\% confidence interval: 2.5-not reached] versus 1.5 months [95\% confidence interval: 1.2-2.3] [p = 0.01]). These findings were comparable to those for patients with and without irAEs 6 weeks after commencement of nivolumab treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Early irAEs are associated with a better outcome after treatment with immunotherapy. We predicted responses to nivolumab by using early irAEs. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of these associations.},

Investigators reported AEs on trial and graded them according to CTCAE v4.0, labeling them as unlikely, possibly, or probably treatment-related. AEs labeled as possibly/probably related were considered trAEs for this analysis. The relationship between the incidence of a trAE and clinical outcomes was evaluated. 97 NSCLC patients treated on KEYNOTE-001 at UCLA were evaluated. 10\% (85/826) of AEs were trAEs, occurring in 40\% (39/97) of patients. The most frequent trAEs were rash (20\% pts), fatigue (6\% pts), and hypothyroidism (6\% pts). The 39 patients that experienced a trAE had increased ORR (38.5\%), PFS (median 248 days), and OS (median 493 days), compared to the 58 patients that did not (ORR: 8.9\%, PFS: median 60 days, OS: median 144.5 days). The observed association between trAEs and improved clinical outcome persisted when using Cox proportional hazards regression models to assess the confounding effect of covariates and mitigate guarantee-time bias. The association also remained when data was sub-stratified by grade, degree of association, and treatment-related select AE designation. This single center analysis revealed that trAEs predicted for improved clinical outcome with pembrolizumab, and when controlling for guarantee-time bias and plausible confounders, this association remained. This observed relationship adds to our understanding of anti-PD-1 therapy and could aid clinicians in identifying patients most likely to benefit from therapy.},

	abstract = {The use of multiple drugs in a single clinical trial or as a therapeutic strategy has become common, particularly in the treatment of cancer. Because traditional trials are designed to evaluate one agent at a time, the evaluation of therapies in combination requires specialized trial designs. In place of the traditional separate phase I and II trials, we propose using a parallel phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate simultaneously the safety and efficacy of combination dose levels, and select the optimal combination dose. The trial is started with an initial period of dose escalation, then patients are randomly assigned to admissible dose levels. These dose levels are compared with each other. Bayesian posterior probabilities are used in the randomization to adaptively assign more patients to doses with higher efficacy levels. Combination doses with lower efficacy are temporarily closed and those with intolerable toxicity are eliminated from the trial. The trial is stopped if the posterior probability for safety, efficacy, or futility crosses a prespecified boundary. For illustration, we apply the design to a combination chemotherapy trial for leukemia. We use simulation studies to assess the operating characteristics of the parallel phase I/II trial design, and compare it to a conventional design for a standard phase I and phase II trial. The simulations show that the proposed design saves sample size, has better power, and efficiently assigns more patients to doses with higher efficacy levels.},

	abstract = {PurposePatients with advanced cancer (ACPs) participating in phase I clinical trials inadequately understand many elements of informed consent (IC); however, the prevalence and impact of cognitive impairment has not been described.Patients and MethodsACPs enrolled onto phase I trials underwent neuropsychological assessment to evaluate cognitive functioning (CF) covering the following domains: memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test), executive functioning (Trail Making Test B), language (Boston Naming Test-Short Version and Controlled Oral Word Association Test), attention (Trail Making Test A and Wechsler Adult Intelligenence Scale-IV Digit Span), comprehension (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV), and quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Cognitive Function). Structured interviews evaluated IC and decisional capacity. Psychological measures included distress (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II).ResultsOne hundred eighteen ACPs on phase I trials were evaluated, with CF ranging from mild impairment to superior performance. Only 45\% of ACPs recalled physician disclosure of the phase I trial purpose. The 50\% of ACPs who correctly identified the phase I research purpose had greater CF compared with ACPs who did not, as revealed by the mean T scores for memory (37.2 ± 5.6 v 32.5 ± 5.1, respectively; P = .001), attention (29 ± 2.7 v 26.9 ± 2.4, respectively; P {\textless} .001), visual attention (35.2 ± 6.6 v 31.5 ± 6.2, respectively; P = .001), and executive function (38.9 ± 7.5 v 34 ± 7.1, respectively; P {\textless} .001). Older ACPs (≥ 60 years) were less likely to recall physician disclosure of phase I purpose than younger ACPs (30\% v 70\%, respectively; P = .02) and had measurable deficits in total memory (34.2 ± 5.0 v 37.3 ± 5.6, respectively; P = .002), attention (24.5 ± 2.6 v 28 ± 2.8, respectively; P {\textless} .001), and executive function (32.8 ± 7.3 v 36.4 ± 7.6, respectively; P = .01). Older ACPs, compared with younger ACPs, also had greater depression scores (10.6 ± 9.2 v 8.1 ± 5.2, respectively; P = .03) and lower quality-of-life scores (152 ± 29.6 v 167 ± 20, respectively; P = .03). After adjustment by age, no psychological or neuropsychological variable was further significantly associated with likelihood of purpose identification.ConclusionCF seems to play a role in ACP recall and comprehension of IC for early-phase clinical trials, especially among older ACPs.},

The DLT for the simultaneous combination was neutropenia and the maximally tolerated dose was vinblastine (1.6 mg m(-2)  every other week) concurrent with toceranib (3.25 mg kg(-1)  PO, every other day). This represents greater than a 50\% reduction in dose intensity for vinblastine (compared with single-agent use) and as such does not support this combination based on current drug combination paradigms. Although a strict adherence to dose paradigms speaks against the combination, evidence of significant activity (71\% objective response) and enhanced myelosuppression suggest additive or synergistic activity.

	abstract = {For many years phase I and phase II clinical trials have been conducted separately, but there has been a recent shift to combine these phases. Although a variety of phase I–II model-based designs for cytotoxic agents have been proposed in the literature, methods for molecularly targeted agents (TAs) are just starting to develop. The main challenge of the TA setting is the unknown dose–efficacy relationship that can have either an increasing, plateau or umbrella shape. To capture these, approaches with more parameters are needed or, alternatively, more orderings are required to account for the uncertainty in the dose–efficacy relationship. As a result, designs for more complex clinical trials, e.g. trials looking at schedules of a combination treatment involving TAs, have not been extensively studied yet. We propose a novel regimen finding design which is based on a derived efficacy–toxicity trade-off function. Because of its special properties, an accurate regimen selection can be achieved without any parametric or monotonicity assumptions. We illustrate how this design can be applied in the context of a complex combination–schedule clinical trial. We discuss practical and ethical issues such as coherence, delayed and missing efficacy responses, safety and futility constraints.},

In this work, model-based adaptive optimal design (MBAOD) was exemplified and evaluated for a combination of paclitaxel and a hypothetical new compound in a phase 1 study to determine the best dosing regimen for a phase 2 trial. Neutropenia was assumed as the main toxicity and the dose optimization process targeted a 33\% probability of grade 4 neutropenia and maximal efficacy (based on preclinical studies) by changing the dose amount of both drugs and the dosing schedule for the new drug. Different starting conditions (e.g., initial dose), search paths (e.g., maximal change in dose intensity per step), and stopping criteria (e.g., “3 + 3 rule”) were explored. The MBAOD approach was successfully implemented allowing the possibility of flexible designs with the modification of doses and dosing schedule throughout the trial. The 3 + 3 rule was shown to be highly conservative (selection of a dosing regimen with at least 90\% of the possible maximal efficacy in less than 21\% of the cases) but also safer (selection of a toxic design in less than 2\% of the cases). Without the 3 + 3 rule, better performance was observed ({\textgreater}67\% of selected designs were associated with at least 90\% of possible maximal efficacy) while the proportion of DLTs per trial was similar. Overall, MBAOD is a promising tool in the context of dose finding studies of combination treatments and was showed to be flexible enough to be associated with requirements imposed by clinical protocols.},

	abstract = {Background
The development of immuno-oncologic agents poses unique challenges, namely that both efficacy and safety profiles differ from previously characterized cytotoxic and pathway-specific agents. In addition, exponential distribution is usually assumed in study designs with time-to-event endpoints such as overall survival or progression-free survival. This assumption might lead to wrong estimates of study duration and statistical power if the phenomena of long term survival and delayed clinical effects are present. The aim here was to evaluate the magnitude of the impact caused by the violation of this assumption, and to describe new ways of analyzing efficacy and safety of immuno-oncologic agents.

Methods
Monte Carlo simulation was implemented to explore the impact of long term survivors and delayed treatment effect on study power and trial duration. Scenarios with various combinations of long term and delayed treatment effects were considered. Study power and duration were evaluated based on 10000 randomly generated trial data sets. The utility of group sequential study designs was discussed. A new set of immune-related response criteria (irRC) was considered for efficacy analysis. Two new methods for identifying adverse events, termed immune-related adverse events (irAE) and immune-mediated adverse reactions (imAR) were described. The key features of the safety profiles derived using these two methods were similar. Both methods were aimed at identifying inflammatory adverse events caused by immunotherapies.

Results
The presence of long term survivors usually lengthened the study duration. Depending on the treatment effect post survival curve separation, delayed clinical effect in general led to a loss of power. The irRC offered a new way of identifying clinical responses. Both safety analyses demonstrated higher sensitivity of identifying adverse events of immune system origin.

Conclusion
This simulation study showed the importance of accounting for the delayed treatment effect and long term survivors when these phenomena were expected. Interim analyses for the purpose of stopping the study for either positive or futile outcome should be implemented with caution in immuno-oncology trials. The new efficacy analysis offered a potential new way of assessing signs of activity in immunotherapies. While the irAE method facilitated prompt and effective management of adverse events, the imAR method captured truly immune-related events.},

Cancer cells, like all evolving organisms, can only adapt to current conditions; they can neither anticipate nor evolve adaptations for treatments that the physician has not yet applied. (2) It has a distinctive leader-follower (or “Stackelberg”) dynamics; the “leader” oncologist plays first and the “follower” cancer cells then respond and adapt to therapy. Current treatment protocols for metastatic cancer typically exploit neither asymmetry. By repeatedly administering the same drug(s) until disease progression, the physician “plays” a fixed strategy even as the opposing cancer cells continuously evolve successful adaptive responses. Furthermore, by changing treatment only when the tumor progresses, the physician cedes leadership to the cancer cells and treatment failure becomes nearly inevitable.

Time to treatment discontinuation was shorter in patients with T790M loss (6.1 vs 15.2 months), suggesting emergence of pre-existing resistant clones; this finding was confirmed in a validation cohort of 110 patients with plasma cell-free DNA genotyping performed after osimertinib resistance. In studies of serial plasma levels of mutant\textit{EGFR}, loss of T790M at resistance was associated with a smaller decrease in levels of the\textit{EGFR}driver mutation after 1 to 3 weeks of therapy (100\% vs 83\% decrease;\textit{P} = .01).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusions and Relevance{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Acquired resistance to osimertinib mediated by loss of the T790M mutation is associated with early resistance and a range of competing resistance mechanisms.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09481},
	abstract = {An essential feature of the adaptive immune system is the proliferation of antigen-specific lymphocytes during an immune reaction to form a large pool of effector cells. This proliferation must be regulated to ensure an effective response to infection while avoiding immunopathology. Recent experiments in mice have demonstrated that the expansion of a specific clone of T cells in response to cognate antigen obeys a striking inverse power law with respect to the initial number of T cells. Here, we show that such a relationship arises naturally from a model in which T cell expansion is limited by decaying levels of presented antigen. The same model also accounts for the observed dependence of T cell expansion on affinity for antigen and on the kinetics of antigen administration. Extending the model to address expansion of multiple T cell clones competing for antigen, we find that higher affinity clones can suppress the proliferation of lower affinity clones, thereby promoting the specificity of the response. Employing the model to derive optimal vaccination protocols, we find that exponentially increasing antigen doses can achieve a nearly optimized response. We thus conclude that the dynamics of presented antigen is a key regulator of both the size and specificity of the adaptive immune response.},

Those given adjuvant therapy with 12 cycles of CMF at this dose level had a five-year relapse-free survival of 77 per cent, as compared with 45 per cent of patients treated only with radical mastectomy (P = 0.0001). In contrast, a subgroup receiving less than 65 per cent of the planned dose had a five-year survival without relapses of 48 per cent and a five-year survival with relapses of 67 per cent. These results are similar to those observed in a control group. With each dose level, the results at five years were influenced by the number of axillary lymph nodes involved but not by menopausal status.

All patients but one had been pretreated with chemotherapy. LCM was given IV as a 1h-infusion, repeated every 3 weeks, from a starting dose of 3 mg/m2, corresponding to 1/3 of the MELD10. An intra-patient dose escalation scheme, with an increase per cycle of 3 mg/m2 up to 12 mg/m2, and then by 2 mg/m2 was applied, treatment being continued until tumour progression, or toxicity, or up to a maximum of 6 cycles, whichever occurred first. Granulocytopenia was dose-limiting, with a GNC count of less than 0.5 x 10(3)/microliters after 30\%, 28\%, 50\% and 50\% of the cycles given at 16, 18, 20 and 22-24 mg/m2, respectively. The lowest GNC count occurred usually 2 weeks after treatment, with recovery in the following week. Gastro-intestinal toxicity, mucositis and alopecia were rare and of mild degree. Two patients, with a subtotal neoplastic involvement of the liver and a pretreatment grade 4 liver impairment, died because of acute liver failure a few days after treatment. The maximum tolerable dose was defined at 22 mg/m2 and 18 mg/m2, given every 3 weeks for 6 cycles, was the regimen recommended for phase II studies. Seven previously untreated patients with metastatic breast cancer have been so far treated. The pattern of toxicity of LCM (specific, short-lasting granulocytopenia; negligible, non cumulative non hematological toxicity) was confirmed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Much of the statistical methodology underlying the experimental design of phase 1 trials in oncology is intended for studies involving a single cytotoxic agent. The goal of these studies is to estimate the maximally tolerated dose, the highest dose that can be administered with an acceptable level of toxicity. A fundamental assumption of these methods is monotonicity of the dose-toxicity curve. This is a reasonable assumption for single-agent trials in which the administration of greater doses of the agent can be expected to produce dose-limiting toxicities in increasing proportions of patients. When studying multiple agents, the assumption may not hold because the ordering of the toxicity probabilities could possibly be unknown for several of the available drug combinations. At the same time, some of the orderings are known and so we describe the whole situation as that of a partial ordering. In this article, we propose a new two-dimensional dose-finding method for multiple-agent trials that simplifies to the continual reassessment method (CRM), introduced by O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher (1990, Biometrics 46, 33-48), when the ordering is fully known. This design enables us to relax the assumption of a monotonic dose-toxicity curve. We compare our approach and some simulation results to a CRM design in which the ordering is known as well as to other suggestions for partial orders.},

	abstract = {T cells directed to endogenous tumor antigens are powerful mediators of tumor regression. Recent immunotherapy advances have identified effective interventions to unleash tumor-specific T-cell activity in patients who naturally develop them. Eliciting T-cell responses to a patient's individual tumor remains a major challenge. Radiation therapy can induce immune responses to model antigens expressed by tumors, but it remains unclear whether it can effectively prime T cells specific for endogenous antigens expressed by poorly immunogenic tumors. We hypothesized that TGFβ activity is a major obstacle hindering the ability of radiation to generate an in situ tumor vaccine. Here, we show that antibody-mediated TGFβ neutralization during radiation therapy effectively generates CD8+ T-cell responses to multiple endogenous tumor antigens in poorly immunogenic mouse carcinomas. Generated T cells were effective at causing regression of irradiated tumors and nonirradiated lung metastases or synchronous tumors (abscopal effect). Gene signatures associated with IFNγ and immune-mediated rejection were detected in tumors treated with radiation therapy and TGFβ blockade in combination but not as single agents. Upregulation of programmed death (PD) ligand-1 and -2 in neoplastic and myeloid cells and PD-1 on intratumoral T cells limited tumor rejection, resulting in rapid recurrence. Addition of anti–PD-1 antibodies extended survival achieved with radiation and TGFβ blockade. Thus, TGFβ is a fundamental regulator of radiation therapy's ability to generate an in situ tumor vaccine. The combination of local radiation therapy with TGFβ neutralization offers a novel individualized strategy for vaccinating patients against their tumors. Cancer Res; 75(11); 2232–42. ©2015 AACR.},

Wrongly assuming a homogeneous population can lead to a diluted treatment effect. Equally, exclusion of a subgroup that could in fact benefit from the treatment can cause a beneficial treatment effect to be missed. Accounting for a potential subgroup effect (ie, difference in reaction to the treatment between subgroups) in dose?escalation can increase the chance of finding the treatment to be efficacious in a larger patient population. A standard Bayesian model?based method of dose?escalation is extended to account for a subgroup effect by including covariates for subgroup membership in the dose?toxicity model. A stratified design performs well but uses available data inefficiently and makes no inferences concerning presence of a subgroup effect. A hypothesis test could potentially rectify this problem but the small sample sizes result in a low?powered test. As an alternative, the use of spike and slab priors for variable selection is proposed. This method continually assesses the presence of a subgroup effect, enabling efficient use of the available trial data throughout escalation and in identifying the recommended dose(s). A simulation study, based on real trial data, was conducted and this design was found to be both promising and feasible.},

Neutropenia is one major side-effect of many antitumor agents, and is related to an increased risk of infection.

In this paper we describe the transfer of a previously developed semi-mechanistic model for myelosuppression from NONMEM to a dosing tool in MS Excel, with etoposide as an example. The tool proved capable to solve a differential equation system describing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, with estimation performance comparable to NONMEM. In the dosing tool the user provides neutrophil measures from a previous treatment course and request for the dose that results in a desired nadir in the upcoming course through a Bayesian estimation procedure.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: New targeted, non-cytotoxic anticancer agents, such as small-molecule kinase inhibitors, pose challenges to the current phase I paradigm of dose selection based on toxicity. Moreover, increasing the drug dose to toxicity may be unnecessary for drug effect, making the use of maximum tolerated dose as a surrogate of effective dose inappropriate in the phase I setting. Because little is known about the optimal methods of recommended phase II dose selection of targeted, non-cytotoxic therapies, we reviewed the strategies that were used in completed phase I studies of these drugs.
METHODS: We retrieved 60 publications of phase I studies involving 31 single agents representative of the most common targets of interest in the oncology literature. For each publication, we abstracted data regarding patient population, starting dose, methods of dose escalation and determination of recommended phase II dose, and inclusion of correlative studies in study conduct.
RESULTS: Of the 60 completed phase I studies, 36 used toxicity and eight used pharmacokinetic data as endpoints for selection of the recommended phase II dose. Nontraditional endpoints, such as measures of molecular drug effects in tumor or surrogate tissue or functional imaging studies, were not routinely incorporated into the study design and rarely formed the primary basis for dose selection.
CONCLUSIONS: To date, phase I studies of targeted anticancer agents have generally used traditional endpoints for selection of the recommended phase II dose. More research is needed to define suitable molecular measures of drug effect and the means to incorporate them in the early drug development process.},

We propose a novel adaptive randomization scheme to favor assigning patients to more efficacious dose-combination arms. Our adaptive randomization scheme takes into account both the point estimate and variability of efficacy. By using a moving reference to compare the relative efficacy among treatment arms, our method achieves a high resolution to distinguish different arms. We also consider groupwise adaptive randomization when efficacy is late-onset. We conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of the proposed design, and illustrate our method using a phase I/II melanoma clinical trial.},

	abstract = {To save valuable time and resources in new drug development, Phase I/II clinical trials with toxicity control and drug efficacy as dual primary endpoints have become increasingly popular. Escalation with over-dose control (the EWOC) is a Bayesian adaptive Phase I clinical trial design that can accurately estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) level and control the probability of overdosing patients during the dose allocation phase. In this paper, we extend EWOC to Phase I/II clinical trials by controlling for under-dosing with a Gumbel Copula model to provide patients with at least minimum drug efficacy. We propose a utility function to measure the composite effect of toxicity and efficacy and select the optimal dose. To deal with the common issue that the efficacy endpoint often cannot be quickly ascertained, we employ Bayesian data augmentation to handle delayed efficacy and allow for flexible patient accrual without a waiting period. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed new design not only provides better therapeutic effect by reducing the probability of treating patients at under-dose levels while protecting patients from being overdosed, but also improves trial efficiency and increases the accuracy of dose recommendation for subsequent clinical trials. We apply the proposed design to a Phase I/II solid tumor trial.},

	abstract = {A Bayesian model and design are described for a phase I-II trial to jointly optimise the doses of a targeted agent and a chemotherapy agent for solid tumors. A challenge in designing the trial was that both the efficacy and toxicity outcomes were defined as four-level ordinal variables. To reflect possibly complex joint effects of the two doses on each of the two outcomes, for each marginal distribution a generalised continuation ratio model was assumed, with each agent's dose parametrically standardised in the linear term. A copula was assumed to obtain a bivariate distribution. Elicited outcome probabilities were used to construct a prior, with variances calibrated to obtain small prior effective sample size. Elicited numerical utilities of the 16 elementary outcomes were used to compute posterior mean utilities as criteria for selecting dose pairs, with adaptive randomisation to reduce the risk of getting stuck at a suboptimal pair. A simulation study showed that parametric dose standardisation with additive dose effects provides a robust, reliable model for dose pair optimisation in this setting, and it compares favourably with designs based on alternative models that include dose-dose interaction terms. The proposed model and method are applicable generally to other clinical trial settings with similar dose and outcome structures.},

For example, if outcomes take up to six weeks to evaluate and the accrual rate is one patient per week, on average three new patients will be accrued while waiting to evaluate the outcomes of the previous three patients. The question is how to treat the new patients. This logistical problem persists throughout the trial. Various ad hoc practical solutions are used, none entirely satisfactory. We focus on this problem in phase I-II clinical trials that use binary toxicity and efficacy, defined in terms of event times, to choose doses adaptively for successive cohorts. We propose a general approach to this problem that treats late-onset outcomes as missing data, uses data augmentation to impute missing outcomes from posterior predictive distributions computed from partial follow-up times and complete outcome data, and applies the design's decision rules using the completed data. We illustrate the method with two cancer trials conducted using a phase I-II design based on efficacy-toxicity trade-offs, including a computer stimulation study.},

Although the importance of phase I clinical trials is widely recognized, there is currently no consensus among the scientific, medical, and statistical communities on how best to do these studies in humans. With the advent of targeted therapies, it has become evident that we need to tailor the design of phase I studies for the particular drug class under investigation and any endpoints that are being defined. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Investigational Drug Steering Committee (IDSC) provides broad external scientific and clinical input on the design and prioritization of early-phase clinical trials with agents for which the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) holds an Investigational New Drug (IND) application through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The IDSC has formed a number of task forces and working groups, including the Clinical Trial Design Task Force and the Biomarker Working Group, many with membership from within the IDSC as well as external experts, including participants from academia, the pharmaceutical industry, and regulatory authorities. The Clinical Trials Design Taskforce sponsored a Phase I Workshop with the primary goal being to develop consensus recommendations for the optimal design of phase I studies. The primary focus included (1) efficient trial designs, (2) phase I drug combinations, and (3) appropriate statistical and correlative endpoints. In this CCR Focus series, articles summarize key aspects and recommendations on phase I studies (including combination trials), such as design, use of biomarkers, the European Union and Japanese perspectives on design, requirements for first-in-human and other phase I studies, and ensuring regulatory and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) compliance.

In a typical drug combination trial, the toxicity profile of each individual drug has already been thoroughly studied in single?agent trials, which naturally offers rich prior information. We propose a Bayesian adaptive design for dose finding that is based on a copula?type model to account for the synergistic effect of two or more drugs in combination. To search for the maximum tolerated dose combination, we continuously update the posterior estimates for the toxicity probabilities of the combined doses. By reordering the dose toxicities in the two?dimensional probability space, we adaptively assign each new cohort of patients to the most appropriate dose. Dose escalation, de?escalation or staying at the same doses is determined by comparing the posterior estimates of the probabilities of toxicity of combined doses and the prespecified toxicity target. We conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of the design and illustrate the proposed method under various practical scenarios.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2288-14-51},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditionally, phase I oncology trials are designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), defined as the highest dose with an acceptable probability of dose limiting toxicities(DLT), of a new treatment via a dose escalation study. An alternate approach is to jointly model toxicity and efficacy and allow dose escalation to depend on a pre-specified efficacy/toxicity tradeoff in a phase I-II design. Several phase I-II trial designs have been discussed in the literature; while these model-based designs are attractive in their performance, they are potentially vulnerable to model misspecification.
METHODS: Phase I-II designs often rely on copula models to specify the joint distribution of toxicity and efficacy, which include an additional correlation parameter that can be difficult to estimate. We compare and contrast three models for the joint probability of toxicity and efficacy, including two copula models that have been proposed for use in phase I-II clinical trials and a simple model that assumes the two outcomes are independent. We evaluate the performance of the various models through simulation both when the models are correct and under model misspecification.
RESULTS: Both models exhibited similar performance, as measured by the probability of correctly identifying the optimal dose and the number of subjects treated at the optimal dose, regardless of whether the data were generated from the correct or incorrect copula, even when there is substantial correlation between the two outcomes. Similar results were observed for a simple model that assumes independence, even in the presence of strong correlation. Further simulation results indicate that estimating the correlation parameter in copula models is difficult with the sample sizes used in Phase I-II clinical trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Our simulation results indicate that the operating characteristics of phase I-II clinical trials are robust to misspecification of the copula model but that a simple model that assumes independence performs just as well due to difficulty in estimating the copula model correlation parameters from binary data.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare three-drug chemotherapy with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate with four-drug chemotherapy with cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and ifosfamide for the treatment of osteosarcoma. To determine whether the addition of muramyl tripeptide (MTP) to chemotherapy enhances event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival in newly diagnosed patients with osteosarcoma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six hundred sixty-two patients with osteosarcoma without clinically detectable metastatic disease and whose disease was considered resectable received one of four prospectively randomized treatments. All patients received identical cumulative doses of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate and underwent definitive surgical resection of primary tumor. Patients were randomly assigned to receive or not to receive ifosfamide and/or MTP in a 2 x 2 factorial design. The primary end points for analysis were EFS and overall survival.
RESULTS: In the current analysis, there was no evidence of interaction, and we were able to examine each intervention separately. The chemotherapy regimens resulted in similar EFS and overall survival. There was a trend toward better EFS with the addition of MTP (P = .08). The addition of MTP to chemotherapy improved 6-year overall survival from 70\% to 78\% (P = .03). The hazard ratio for overall survival with the addition of MTP was 0.71 (95\% CI, 0.52 to 0.96).
CONCLUSION: The addition of ifosfamide to cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate did not enhance EFS or overall survival for patients with osteosarcoma. The addition of MTP to chemotherapy resulted in a statistically significant improvement in overall survival and a trend toward better EFS.},

There are some distinctive features in the case of bridging which need to be considered if efficient estimation of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is to be accomplished. The case of two distinct populations is considered. In the bridging setting we usually have in mind two studies, corresponding to the two populations. In some cases, the first of these studies may have been completed while the second has yet to be initiated. In other cases, the studies take place simultaneously and information can then be shared among the two groups. The methodological problem is how to make most use of the information gained in the first study to help improve efficiency in the second. We describe the models that we can use for the purpose of bridging and study situations in which their use leads to overall improvements in performance as well as cases where there is no gain when compared to carrying out parallel studies.

However, very few methods have been developed to consider toxicity attributions in the dose escalation process. We are motivated by a trial in which the clinician is able to identify certain toxicities that can be attributed to one of the agents. We present a Bayesian adaptive design in which toxicity attributions are modeled via copula regression and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) curve is estimated as a function of model parameters. The dose escalation algorithm uses cohorts of two patients, following the continual reassessment method (CRM) scheme, where at each stage of the trial, we search for the dose of one agent given the current dose of the other agent. The performance of the design is studied by evaluating its operating characteristics when the underlying model is either correctly specified or misspecified. We show that this method can be extended to accommodate discrete dose combinations.},

	doi = {10.1002/sim.6912},
	abstract = {In oncology, combinations of drugs are often used to improve treatment efficacy and/or reduce harmful side effects. Dual-agent phase I clinical trials assess drug safety and aim to discover a maximum tolerated dose combination via dose-escalation; cohorts of patients are given set doses of both drugs and monitored to see if toxic reactions occur. Dose-escalation decisions for subsequent cohorts are based on the number and severity of observed toxic reactions, and an escalation rule. In a combination trial, drugs may be administered concurrently or non-concurrently over a treatment cycle. For two drugs given non-concurrently with overlapping toxicities, toxicities occurring after administration of the first drug yet before administration of the second may be attributed directly to the first drug, whereas toxicities occurring after both drugs have been given some present ambiguity; toxicities may be attributable to the first drug only, the second drug only or the synergistic combination of both. We call this mixture of attributable and non-attributable toxicity semi-attributable toxicity. Most published methods assume drugs are given concurrently, which may not be reflective of trials with non-concurrent drug administration. We incorporate semi-attributable toxicity into Bayesian modelling for dual-agent phase I trials with non-concurrent drug administration and compare the operating characteristics to an approach where this detail is not considered. Simulations based on a trial for non-concurrent administration of intravesical Cabazitaxel and Cisplatin in early-stage bladder cancer patients are presented for several scenarios and show that including semi-attributable toxicity data reduces the number of patients given overly toxic combinations. © 2016 The Authors.

	abstract = {PURPOSEChoosing maximum-tolerated doses (MTDs) of agents to be administered in combination is more complicated than choosing the MTD for a single agent. This is because there are many combinations of doses that will be tolerated. We offer guidance in targeting specific MTD combinations, and suggest trial designs to achieve these targets.METHODSA graphical method based on a simple, previously described mathematical model is used to guide the phase I trial design. The method involves constructing a tolerable-dose diagram, which displays the toxicities that are expected to occur at various dose combinations. The data required for the method are the single-agent toxicity profiles of the agents. Designs for combinations of taxol with fluorouracil, carboplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and cisplatin are used to demonstrate the methods.RESULTSFor all of the drugs considered here, leukopenia is dose-limiting or nearly dose-limiting. Consequently, no major improvement in total dose-intensity is achievable by combining these drugs. If leukopenia can be eliminated or substantially reduced by use of chemoprotective agents, then a cyclophosphamide/taxol combination appears promising from a dose-intensity point of view. For other combinations, the doses must be reduced from single-agent MTD levels. In the absence of biologic information such as concentrations needed for optimal modulation, it is suggested that single-agent MTDs be reduced approximately proportionately for each drug in the combination.CONCLUSIONTolerable-dose diagrams are useful for planning phase I trials of combinations of agents. They can suggest which combinations are promising from a dose-intensity perspective, as well as dose-escalation schemes for combinations to be pursued for dose-intensity or other considerations.},

However, if there are other differences between the cohorts, such as differences in environmental health factors, type of person or experimental procedure, then these differences may obscure the differences between doses. Therefore, cohorts should be fitted in the analysis, as either fixed or random effects. I suggest that, if this is done, then there are three simple principles that reduce variance (i) allocating no more than half the subjects in any cohort to any single dose; (ii) subject to safety constraints, using as many different doses as possible in each cohort; (iii) using one more cohort than the number of doses, without increasing the total number of subjects. Using these principles, I propose some new designs that conform to the safety rules of traditional dose-escalation trials while reducing the variance of the estimators of differences between the doses by a factor of two or more, for the same number of subjects.},

Medi 2009; this issue) puts the focus on efficiency in dose-finding studies and shows that some quite simple modifications to much current experimentation can lead to significant efficiency gains. Efficiency has not been the main focus of interest in this field, in particular when dealing with situations requiring other than healthy volunteers. Dr Bailey's results are important, both in theory and in practice and also raise the question as to what ought to be the guiding principle to statistical workers in this field. Safety, although escaping any simple definition, has mostly guided experimentation in dose-finding studies; one reason being that the concept is one on which clinicians and statisticians can come to some broad agreement. Finding such agreement may still be the single major difficulty in these studies, alongside the establishment of criteria that all of the scientists involved believe are the most appropriate and useful ones.},

This has been used in 2206 consecutive unselected inductions, in which variables considered to be likely to influence the dosage were recorded. Milligram per kilogram is the most acceptable method of expressing the average dosage of thiopentone. Doses follow a right skew distribution. Women required a significantly lower average dose of thiopentone than men, while obese patients required less than others. Moderate or heavy drinking increased the induction dose but the use of tobacco did not have any influence. The most important factors governing dosage are the physical fitness of the patient and the premedication used. Patients in ASA grades 1 and 2 required significantly more thiopentone than those in grades 3 and 4. This effect is as great as that of premedication in which an opiate with a phenothiazine or hyoscine markedly reduced the induction dose. It was more important than the patient's pre-operative condition with respect to sedation or apprehension. Small doses of opiates or benzodiazepines do not have as much effect on dosage.},

	abstract = {Premarketing dose-ranging studies of a drug are done to establish a reasonable initial dose. According to the current procedure sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration, each patient is given one of several possible doses, including placebo, after an initial placebo run-in period. Data analysis is based on a model in which the mean response at each dose is independent of the magnitude of the dose. The initial dose is the lowest dose tested that has a response that is statistically significantly greater than the response after placebo administration. We suggest that the present conceptual approach to, and standard study design and analysis for, dose-ranging studies be changed. We believe one must begin with a parametric model for patient-specific dose-response curves. Knowledge of the distribution of these curves in a population provides a basis for choice of an initial dose (e.g., the dose that achieves a given response in a given fraction of patients) and, after observation of response to an initial dose, for choice of an incremental dose for a specific patient (by use of Bayes rule). The current parallel-dose design can provide only poor information about the distribution of dose-response curves, biased estimates of the typical curve, and little information on interpatient variability. Crossover studies provide better information. In studies in which a parametric patient-specific dose-response model is used, a dose-escalation design provides no less information than a crossover design, and it has ethical advantages that allow a more representative patient group and clinical setting to be studied.},

Convection-enhanced delivery has been proposed as a means to efficiently deliver therapeutic agents directly into the brainstem while minimising systemic exposure and associated toxic effects. We did this study to evaluate the safety of convection-enhanced delivery of a radioimmunotherapy agent targeting the glioma-associated B7-H3 antigen in children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We did a phase 1, single-arm, single-centre, dose-escalation study at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY, USA). Eligible patients were aged 3–21 years and had diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma as diagnosed by consensus of a multidisciplinary paediatric neuro-oncology team; a Lansky (patients {\textless}16 years of age) or Karnofsky (patients ≥16 years) performance score of at least 50 at study entry; a minimum weight of 8 kg; and had completed external beam radiation therapy (54·0–59·4 Gy at 1·8 Gy per fraction over 30–33 fractions) at least 4 weeks but no more than 14 weeks before enrolment. Seven dose-escalation cohorts were planned based on standard 3 + 3 rules: patients received a single infusion of 9·25, 18·5, 27·75, 37, 92·5, 120·25, or 148 MBq, respectively, at a concentration of about 37 MBq/mL by convection-enhanced delivery of the radiolabelled antibody [$^{\textrm{124}}$I]-8H9. The primary endpoint was identification of the maximum tolerated dose. The analysis of the primary endpoint was done in the per-protocol population (patients who received the full planned dose of treatment), and all patients who received any dose of study treatment were included in the safety analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01502917, and is ongoing with an expanded cohort.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}From April 5, 2012, to Oct 8, 2016, 28 children were enrolled and treated in the trial, of whom 25 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached as no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. One (4\%) of 28 patients had treatment-related transient grade 3 hemiparesis and one (4\%) had grade 3 skin infection. No treatment-related grade 4 adverse events or deaths occurred. Estimated volumes of distribution (Vd) were linearly dependent on volumes of infusion (Vi) and ranged from 1·5 to 20·1 cm$^{\textrm{3}}$, with a mean Vd/Vi ratio of 3·4 (SD 1·2). The mean lesion absorbed dose was 0·39 Gy/MBq $^{\textrm{124}}$I (SD 0·20). Systemic exposure was negligible, with an average lesion-to-whole body ratio of radiation absorbed dose higher than 1200.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Convection-enhanced delivery in the brainstem of children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma who have previously received radiation therapy seems to be a rational and safe therapeutic strategy. PET-based dosimetry of the radiolabelled antibody [$^{\textrm{124}}$I]-8H9 validated the principle of using convection-enhanced delivery in the brain to achieve high intra-lesional dosing with negligible systemic exposure. This therapeutic strategy warrants further development for children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}National Institutes of Health, The Dana Foundation, The Cure Starts Now, Solving Kids' Cancer, The Lyla Nsouli Foundation, Cookies for Kids' Cancer, The Cristian Rivera Foundation, Battle for a Cure, Cole Foundation, Meryl \& Charles Witmer Charitable Foundation, Tuesdays with Mitch Charitable Foundation, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Although the true incidence of dermatological adverse events (AEs) in patients receiving taxanes is not known, and has never been prospectively analysed, they clearly represent one of the major AEs associated with these agents. With an increase in the occurrence of cutaneous AEs during treatment with novel targeted and immunological therapies when used in combination with taxanes, a thorough understanding of reactions attributable to this class is imperative. Moreover, identification and management of dermatological AEs is critical for maintaining the quality of life in cancer patients and for minimizing dose modifications of their antineoplastic regimen.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: In the proper context, radiation therapy (RT) can promote anti-tumor immunity. It is unknown if elective nodal irradiation (ENI), a strategy that irradiates tumor-associated draining lymph nodes (DLN), impacts adaptive immune responses and combinatorial efficacy of RT with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We developed a preclinical model to compare stereotactic RT (Tumor RT) with or without ENI to examine immunological differences between RT techniques that spare or irradiate the DLN. RESULTS: Tumor RT was associated with up-regulation of an intratumoral T-cell chemoattractant chemokine signature (CXCR3, CCR5-related) that resulted in robust infiltration of antigen-specific CD8+ effector T-cells as well as FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The addition of ENI attenuated chemokine expression, restrained immune infiltration and adversely impacted survival when combined with ICB, especially with anti-CLTA4 therapy. The combination of stereotactic RT and ICB led to long-term survival in a subset of mice and was associated with favorable CD8 effector-to-Treg ratios and increased intratumoral density of antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells. While RT technique (Tumor RT vs. ENI) impacted initial tumor control and survival, the ability to reject tumor upon re-challenge was partially dependent upon the mechanism of action of ICB; as RT/anti-CTLA4 was superior to RT/anti-PD-1. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight that irradiation of the DLN restrains adaptive immune responses through altered chemokine expression and CD8+ T-cell trafficking. These data have implications for combining RT and ICB, long-term survival and induction of immunological memory. Clinically, the immunomodulatory effect of the RT strategy should be considered when combining stereotactic RT with immunotherapy.},

Based on these data, as well as the potential serious toxicities of supranutritional doses of selenium, a phase I trial of a combination of selenium/carboplatin/paclitaxel was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose, safety, and effects of selenium on carboplatin pharmacokinetics in the treatment of chemo-naive women with gynecologic cancers. Correlative studies were performed to identify gene targets of selenium.
METHODS: Chemo-naïve patients with gynecologic malignancy received selenious acid IV on day 1 followed by carboplatin IV and paclitaxel IV on day 3. A standard 3 + 3 dose-escalating design was used for addition of selenium to standard dose chemotherapy. Concentrations of selenium in plasma and carboplatin in plasma ultrafiltrate were analyzed.
RESULTS: Forty-five patients were enrolled and 291 treatment cycles were administered. Selenium was administered as selenious acid to 9 cohorts of patients with selenium doses ranging from 50 μg to 5000 μg. Grade 3/4 toxicities included neutropenia (66.7\%), febrile neutropenia (2.2\%), pain (20.0\%), infection (13.3\%), neurologic (11.1\%), and pulmonary adverse effects (11.1\%). The maximum tolerated dose of selenium was not reached. Selenium had no effect on carboplatin pharmacokinetics. Correlative studies showed post-treatment downregulation of RAD51AP1, a protein involved in DNA repair, in both cancer cell lines and patient tumors.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the addition of selenium to carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy is safe and well tolerated, and does not alter carboplatin pharmacokinetics. A 5000 μg dose of elemental selenium as selenious acid is suggested as the dose to be evaluated in a phase II trial.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Purpose: Checkpoint inhibitors demonstrate salutary anti-cancer effects including long-term remissions. PD-L1 expression/amplification, high mutational burden and mismatch repair-deficiency correlate with response. We have, however, observed a subset of patients who appear to be "hyper-progressors," with a greatly accelerated rate of tumor growth and clinical deterioration compared to pre-therapy, which was also recently reported by Institut Gustave Roussy. The current study investigated potential genomic markers associated with "hyper-progression" after immunotherapy. Method: Consecutive stage IV cancer patients who received immunotherapies (CTLA-4, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors or other [investigational] agents) and had their tumor evaluated by next-generation sequencing were analyzed (N=155). We defined hyper-progression as time-to-treatment failure (TTF) \&lt;2 months, \&gt;50\% increase in tumor burden compared to pre-immunotherapy imaging, and \&gt;2-fold increase in progression pace. Results: Amongst 155 patients, TTF \&lt;2 months was seen in all six individuals with MDM2/MDM4 amplification. After anti-PD1/PDL1 monotherapy, four of these patients showed remarkable increases in existing tumor size (55\% to 258\%), new large masses, and significantly accelerated progression pace (2.3-, 7.1-, 7.2- and 42.3-fold compared to the two months before immunotherapy). In multivariate analysis, MDM2/MDM4 and EGFR alterations correlated with TTF\&lt;2 months. Two of 10 patients with EGFR alterations were also hyper-progressors (53.6\% and 125\% increase in tumor size; 35.7- and 41.7-fold increase). Conclusion: Some patients with MDM2 family amplification or EGFR aberrations had poor clinical outcome and significantly increased rate of tumor growth after single-agent checkpoint (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors. Genomic profiles may help to identify patients at risk for progression on immunotherapy. Further investigation is urgently needed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, despite advances that include having patients and advocates involved in clinical research projects that may directly, or eventually, affect their care and treatment, we have much further to go to make this a truly inclusionary participation in research. We have even further to go to actively incorporate patients and advocates throughout the research continuum. Here we review and present current programs and projects that have successfully incorporated patients and advocates into translational research, and propose mechanism and strategies to actively engage patients throughout the research continuum. Our goal in translational cancer research is to improve outcomes for cancer patients. To more successfully and quickly meet this objective we should incorporate patient driven research questions earlier in the process, specifically at the level of basic benchtop research.},

	abstract = {'Double-hit lymphomas' (DHL), defined by concurrent MYC and BCL2 (or, alternatively, BCL6) rearrangements, have a very poor outcome compared to standard-risk, diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Consequently, dose-intensive (DI) therapies and/or consolidation with high-dose therapy and transplant have been explored in DHL, although benefit has been debated. This meta-analysis compared survival outcomes in DHL patients receiving dose-escalated regimens [DI: R-Hyper-CVAD (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone) or R-CODOX-M/IVAC (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, methotrexate/ifosfamide, etoposide, high dose cytarabine); or intermediate-dose: R-EPOCH (rituximab, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone)] versus standard-dose regimens (R-CHOP; rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) in the first-line setting. Data were synthesized to estimate hazard ratios of dose-escalated treatments versus R-CHOP using a Weibull proportional hazards model within a Bayesian meta-analysis framework. Eleven studies examining 394 patients were included. Patients were treated with either front-line R-CHOP (n = 180), R-EPOCH (n = 91), or R-Hyper-CVAD/rituximab, methotrexate, cytarabine (R-M/C), R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC (DI) (n = 123). Our meta-analysis revealed that median progression-free survival (n = 350) for the R-CHOP, R-EPOCH and DI groups was 12·1, 22·2, and 18·9 months, respectively. First-line treatment with R-EPOCH significantly reduced the risk of a progression compared with R-CHOP (relative risk reduction of 34\%; P = 0·032); however, overall survival (n = 374) was not significantly different across treatment approaches. A subset of patients might benefit from intensive induction with/without transplant. Further investigation into the role of transplant and novel therapy combinations is necessary.},

Although many salvage regimens have been developed, there is no standard of care. Brentuximab vedotin and gemcitabine have been shown to be active in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma when used as monotherapy, and each has been successfully used in combination with other agents. Preclinical data suggest that brentuximab vedotin can sensitise lymphoma cells to gemcitabine, supporting the use of the combination.

Eligible patients were aged younger than 30 years, had no previous brentuximab vedotin exposure, and had primary refractory disease or relapse of less than 1 year from completion of initial treatment. Each 21-day cycle consisted of 1000 mg/m$^{\textrm{2}}$ intravenous gemcitabine on days 1 and 8 and intravenous brentuximab vedotin on day 1 at 1·4 mg/kg or 1·8 mg/kg. The primary objectives were to establish the recommended phase 2 dose of brentuximab vedotin in this combination, the safety of the combination, and the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response among those treated at the recommended phase 2 level, within four cycles of treatment.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown important benefits in phase 3 trials, and several agents have been approved for specific malignancies. Although adverse events from immune checkpoint inhibitors are a common occurrence, cardiotoxic effects are uncommon, but are often serious complications with a relatively high mortality. Most cardiotoxic effects appear to be inflammatory in nature. Clinical assessment of a combination of biomarkers, electrocardiography, cardiac imaging, and endomyocardial biopsy can be used to confirm a possible diagnosis. In this Review, we discuss the epidemiology of immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated cardiotoxic effects, as well as their clinical presentation, subtypes, risk factors, pathophysiology, and clinical management, including the introduction of a new surveillance strategy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) is now well established as a method for estimating the parameters of the general Gaussian linear model with a structured covariance matrix, in particular for mixed linear models. Conventionally, estimates of precision and inference for fixed effects are based on their asymptotic distribution, which is known to be inadequate for some small-sample problems. In this paper, we present a scaled Wald statistic, together with an F approximation to its sampling distribution, that is shown to perform well in a range of small sample settings. The statistic uses an adjusted estimator of the covariance matrix that has reduced small sample bias. This approach has the advantage that it reproduces both the statistics and F distributions in those settings where the latter is exact, namely for Hotelling T2 type statistics and for analysis of variance F-ratios. The performance of the modified statistics is assessed through simulation studies of four different REML analyses and the methods are illustrated using three examples.},

	abstract = {We hypothesized that incremental improvements in the cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy regimen through optimization of drug selection, schedule, and pharmacokinetics would improve outcome in patients with large B-cell lymphomas. A prospective multi-institutional study of administration of etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin for 96 hours with bolus doses of cyclophosphamide and oral prednisone (EPOCH therapy) was done in 50 patients with previously untreated large B-cell lymphomas. The doses of etoposide, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide were adjusted 20\% each cycle to achieve a nadir absolute neutrophil count below 0.5 x 10(9)/L. The median age of the patients was 46 years (range, 20-88 years); 24\% were older than 60 years; and 44\% were at high-intermediate or high risk according to International Prognostic Index (IPI) criteria. There was a complete response in 92\% of patients, and at the median follow-up time of 62 months, the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 70\% and 73\%, respectively. Neither IPI risk factors nor the index itself was associated with response, PFS, or OS. Doses were escalated in 58\% of cycles, and toxicity levels were tolerable. Significant inverse correlations were observed between dose intensity and age for all adjusted agents, and drug clearance of doxorubicin and free etoposide was also inversely correlated with age (r = -0.54 and P(2) =.08 and r = -0.45 and P(2) =.034, respectively). Free-etoposide clearance increased significantly during successive cycles (P(2) =.015). Lymphomas with proliferation of at least 80\% had somewhat lower progression and those expressing bcl-2 had significantly higher progression (P(2) =.04). Expression of bcl-2 may discriminate the recently described activated B-like from germinal-center B-like large-cell lymphomas and provide important pathobiologic and prognostic information. Dose-adjusted EPOCH may produce more cell kill than CHOP-based regimens. Dynamic dose adjustment may overcome inadequate drug concentrations, particularly in younger patients, and compensate for increased drug clearance over time.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma is a distinct subtype of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma that is closely related to nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients are usually young and present with large mediastinal masses. There is no standard treatment, but the inadequacy of immunochemotherapy alone has resulted in routine consolidation with mediastinal radiotherapy, which has potentially serious late effects. We aimed to develop a strategy that improves the rate of cure and obviates the need for radiotherapy.
METHODS: We conducted a single-group, phase 2, prospective study of infusional dose-adjusted etoposide, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide with vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) and filgrastim without radiotherapy in 51 patients with untreated primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. We used results from a retrospective study of DA-EPOCH-R from another center to independently verify the outcomes.
RESULTS: The patients had a median age of 30 years (range, 19 to 52) and a median tumor diameter of 11 cm; 59\% were women. During a median of 5 years of follow-up, the event-free survival rate was 93\%, and the overall survival rate was 97\%. Among the 16 patients who were involved in the retrospective analysis at another center, over a median of 3 years of follow-up, the event-free survival rate was 100\%, and no patients received radiotherapy. No late morbidity or cardiac toxic effects were found in any patients. After follow-up ranging from 10 months to 14 years, all but 2 of the 51 patients (4\%) who received DA-EPOCH-R alone were in complete remission. The 2 remaining patients received radiotherapy and were disease-free at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with DA-EPOCH-R obviated the need for radiotherapy in patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00001337.).},

Refined dosing in special populations is imperative to improve therapeutic response and/or lowering the risk of toxicity. Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) may improve treatment outcomes by achieving the optimal dose for an individual patient. There is, however, relatively little published evidence of large-scale utility and impact of MIPD, where it is often implemented as local collaborative efforts between academia and healthcare. This article highlights some successful applications of bringing MIPD to clinical care and proposes strategies for wider integration in healthcare. Considerations are brought up herein that will need addressing to see MIPD become “widespread clinical practice,” among those, wider interdisciplinary collaborations and the necessity for further evidence-based efficacy and cost–benefit analysis of MIPD in healthcare. The implications of MIPD on regulatory policies and pharmaceutical development are also discussed as part of the roadmap.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Adverse events in chemotherapy clinical trials are assessed and reported by clinicians, yet clinician accuracy in assessing symptoms has been questioned. We compared patient reporting of eight symptoms using a validated instrument, the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30 or QLQ) with physicians' reporting of the same symptoms in the study's adverse events log.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven men with metastatic, androgen-independent prostate cancer enrolled onto a phase II trial of weekly calcitriol and docetaxel completed the QLQ every 4 weeks for up to 28 weeks. A patient-reported symptom was defined as an increase in a QLQ symptom score by at least 10 points (0 to 100 scale), sustained for at least 4 weeks. A physician-reported symptom was considered present if it was ever documented in the adverse event log.
RESULTS: Forty-nine (new or worsened) symptoms were detected by both physician and QLQ, 48 symptoms were detected by the physician alone, and 55 symptoms were detected by the QLQ alone. They agreed on the absence of a symptom in 102 instances of 254 possible opportunities. Their uncorrected agreement was 59.4\%, but Cohen's kappa, a coefficient of agreement that corrects for chance, was 0.15, indicating only slight agreement. Using the QLQ as the standard, overall physician sensitivity and specificity was 47\% and 68\%, respectively, although it varied considerably among symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Even in a tightly controlled clinical trial, physician reporting was neither sensitive nor specific in detecting common chemotherapy adverse effects. Tools for collecting patient-reported adverse event data in chemotherapy clinical trials should be developed.},

I argue that Phase I trials do not offer the prospect of direct benefit and classifying them as if they do fails to acknowledge the moral relevance of the researchers' intent. In Subpart D, research that does not provide the prospect of direct benefit can be approved locally if it does not expose the children to more than a minor increase over minimal risk. If the risks are greater, the research must be approved nationally. To avoid the need for national review for Phase I oncology trials, I propose a new research category that incorporates the concept of "secondary direct benefit." In this category, the child's dissent would be dispositive. This new category would improve the protections provided to children by incorporating intentions into Subpart D, the absence of which is a serious flaw in our current regulatory schema.},

Experimental Design: 3+3 design was used for dose escalation of oral veliparib in combination with carboplatin (AUC 5 on Day 1) and etoposide (100 mg/m$^{\textrm{2}}$ on Days 1-3) in 21-day cycles. Veliparib dose was explored from 80-240mg twice daily (BID) on 7-day, 14-day or continuous schedules. Patients without disease progression continued on maintenance monotherapy (veliparib 400mg BID) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Results: Thirty-nine patients were enrolled to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 240 mg veliparib for 14-days combined with carboplatin and etoposide based on long-term tolerability. Dose-limiting toxicity occurred in one patient (grade 2 toxic motor polyneuropathy) at veliparib 240 mg BID 7-days. Most common adverse events related to veliparib were nausea (39\%), fatigue (39\%), and hematologic toxicities. Continuous dosing of veliparib 240 mg BID with carboplatin and etoposide resulted in excessive chemotherapy dose delays due to hematologic toxicity (grade 3/4 neutropenia/thrombocytopenia). Etoposide pharmacokinetics was not affected by veliparib. Confirmed responses occurred in 17/39 (44\%) and 16/25 (64\%) of all enrolled and ED SCLC patients, respectively. At the recommended phase 2 dose, confirmed responses occurred in 6/13 (46\%) and 5/6 (83\%) of all enrolled and ED SCLC patients, respectively. Conclusions: Veliparib (240mg BID 14-days) plus carboplatin/etoposide can be safely combined. Phase 2 of this study is ongoing in first-line patients with ED SCLC.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The cytotoxic drugs are characterised by steep dose-response relationships and narrow therapeutic windows. Inter-individual pharmacokinetic (PK) variability is often substantial. There are, however, a multitude of reasons why TDM has never been fully implemented in daily oncology practice. These include difficulties in establishing appropriate concentration target, common use of combination chemotherapies and the paucity of published data from pharmacological trials. The situation is different with targeted therapies. The large interindividual PK variability is influenced by the pharmacogenetic background of the patient (e.g. cytochrome P450 and ABC transporters polymorphisms), patient characteristics such as adherence to treatment and environmental factors (drug-drug interactions).

	abstract = {Most anticancer drugs are characterised by a steep dose-response relationship and narrow therapeutic window. Inter-individual pharmacokinetic (PK) variability is often substantial. The most relevant PK parameter for cytotoxic drugs is the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC). Thus it is somewhat surprising that therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is still uncommon for the majority of agents. Goals of the review were to assess the rationale for more widely used TDM of cytotoxics in oncology. There are several reasons why TDM has never been fully implemented into daily oncology practice. These include difficulties in establishing appropriate concentration target ranges, common use of combination chemotherapies for many tumour types, analytical challenges with prodrugs, intracellular compounds, the paucity of published data from pharmacological trials and 'Day1 = Day21' administration schedules. There are some specific situations for which these limitations are overcome, including high dose methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil infusion, mitotane and some high dose chemotherapy regimens. TDM in paediatric oncology represents an important challenge. Established TDM approaches includes the widely used anticancer agents carboplatin, busulfan and methotrexate, with 13-cis-retinoic acid also recently of interest. Considerable effort should be made to better define concentration-effect relationships and to utilise tools such as population PK/PD models and comparative randomised trials of classic dosing versus pharmacokinetically guided adaptive dosing. There is an important heterogeneity among clinical practices and a strong need to promote TDM guidelines among the oncological community.},

	doi = {10.1093/jnci/djp386},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In cancer treatment trials, the standard source of adverse symptom data is clinician reporting by use of items from the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Patient self-reporting has been proposed as an additional data source, but the implications of such a shift are not understood.
METHODS: Patients with lung cancer receiving chemotherapy and their clinicians independently reported six CTCAE symptoms and Karnofsky Performance Status longitudinally at sequential office visits. To compare how patient's vs clinician's reports relate to sentinel clinical events, a time-dependent Cox regression model was used to measure associations between reaching particular CTCAE grade severity thresholds with the risk of death and emergency room visits. To measure concordance of CTCAE reports with indices of daily health status, Kendall tau rank correlation coefficients were calculated for each symptom with EuroQoL EQ-5D questionnaire and global question scores. Statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: A total of 163 patients were enrolled for an average of 12 months (range = 1-28 months), with a mean of 11 visits and 67 (41\%) deaths. CTCAE reports were submitted by clinicians at 95\% of visits and by patients at 80\% of visits. Patients generally reported symptoms earlier and more frequently than clinicians. Statistically significant associations with death and emergency room admissions were seen for clinician reports of fatigue (P {\textless} .001), nausea (P = .01), constipation (P = .038), and Karnofsky Performance Status (P {\textless} .001) but not for patient reports of these items. Higher concordance with EuroQoL EQ-5D questionnaire and global question scores was observed for patient-reported symptoms than for clinician-reported symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinally collected clinician CTCAE assessments better predict unfavorable clinical events, whereas patient reports better reflect daily health status. These perspectives are complementary, each providing clinically meaningful information. Inclusion of both types of data in treatment trial results and drug labels appears to be warranted.},

Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had stage IIIB or IV or recurrent NSCLC and disease progression after treatment with a platinum-containing doublet, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1, an estimated life expectancy of more than 12 weeks, and adequate haematological, renal, and hepatic function. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive voice-response system with a stratified permuted block method with variable block length, to receive either avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or docetaxel 75 mg/m$^{\textrm{2}}$ every 3 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression (≥1\% \textit{vs} {\textless}1\% of tumour cells), which was measured with the 73–10 assay, and histology (squamous \textit{vs} non-squamous). The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed when roughly 337 events (deaths) had occurred in the PD-L1-positive population. Efficacy was analysed in all PD-L1-positive patients (ie, PD-L1 expression in ≥1\% of tumour cells) randomly assigned to study treatment (the primary analysis population) and then in all randomly assigned patients through a hierarchical testing procedure.

In patients with PD-L1-positive tumours, median overall survival did not differ significantly between the avelumab and docetaxel groups (11·4 months [95\% CI 9·4–13·9] \textit{vs} 10·3 months [8·5–13·0]; hazard ratio 0·90 [96\% CI 0·72–1·12]; one-sided p=0·16).

The most common grade 3–5 treatment-related adverse events were infusion-related reaction (six patients [2\%]) and increased lipase (four [1\%]) in the avelumab group and neutropenia (51 [14\%]), febrile neutropenia (37 [10\%]), and decreased neutrophil counts (36 [10\%]) in the docetaxel group.

	doi = {10.1093/jnci/djs141},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In designing phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs), the expected magnitude of the benefit of the experimental therapy (δ) determines the number of patients required and the number of person-years of follow-up. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate how reliably δ approximates the observed benefit (B) in RCTs that evaluated cancer treatment.
METHODS: RCTs evaluating systemic therapy in adult cancer patients published in 10 journals from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2009, were identified. Data were extracted from each publication independently by two investigators. The related-samples Sign test was used to determine whether the median difference between δ and B was statistically significant in different study subsets and was two-sided.
RESULTS: A total of 253 RCTs met the eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. Regardless of whether benefit was defined as proportional change (median difference between δ and B = -13.0\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = -21.0\% to -8.0\%), absolute change (median difference between δ and B = -8.0\%, 95\% CI = -9.9\% to -5.1\%), or median increase in a time-to-event endpoint (median difference between δ and B = -1.4 months, 95\% CI = -2.1 to -0.8 months), δ was consistently and statistically significantly larger than B (P {\textless} .001, for each, respectively). This relationship between δ and B was independent of year of publication, industry funding, management by cooperative trial groups, type of control arm, type of experimental arm, disease site, adjuvant treatment, or treatment for advanced disease, and likely contributed to the high proportion of negative RCTs (158 [62.5\%] of 253 studies).
CONCLUSIONS: Investigators consistently make overly optimistic assumptions regarding treatment benefits when designing RCTs. Attempts to reduce the number of negative RCTs should focus on more realistic estimations of δ. Increased use of interim analyses, certain adaptive trial designs, and better biological characterization of patients are potential ways of mitigating this problem.},

	doi = {10.1200/JCO.2013.49.8808},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: All patients in phase I trials do not have equivalent susceptibility to serious drug-related toxicity (SDRT). Our goal was to develop a nomogram to predict the risk of cycle-one SDRT to better select appropriate patients for phase I trials.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The prospectively maintained database of patients with solid tumor enrolled onto Cancer Therapeutics Evaluation Program-sponsored phase I trials activated between 2000 and 2010 was used. SDRT was defined as a grade ≥ 4 hematologic or grade ≥ 3 nonhematologic toxicity attributed, at least possibly, to study drug(s). Logistic regression was used to test the association of candidate factors to cycle-one SDRT. A final model, or nomogram, was chosen based on both clinical and statistical significance and validated internally using a bootstrapping technique and externally in an independent data set.
RESULTS: Data from 3,104 patients enrolled onto 127 trials were analyzed to build the nomogram. In a model with multiple covariates, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, WBC count, creatinine clearance, albumin, AST, number of study drugs, biologic study drug (yes v no), and dose (relative to maximum administered) were significant predictors of cycle-one SDRT. All significant factors except dose were included in the final nomogram. The model was validated both internally (bootstrap-adjusted concordance index, 0.60) and externally (concordance index, 0.64).
CONCLUSION: This nomogram can be used to accurately predict a patient's risk for SDRT at the time of enrollment. Excluding patients at high risk for SDRT should improve the safety and efficiency of phase I trials.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Romidepsin is a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI) with activity in T-cell lymphoma. Given preclinical data showing greater induction of gene expression with longer exposures to HDIs, a phase I study of a day 1, 3, and 5 romidepsin schedule was evaluated. A secondary objective was to assess the effect of romidepsin on radioactive iodine (RAI) uptake in thyroid cancers.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Open-label, single-arm, phase I, 3 + 3 dose escalation study. Romidepsin was administered as a 4-hour infusion on days 1, 3, and 5 of a 21-day cycle. Pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) were assessed, including histone acetylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), RAI uptake in refractory thyroid cancer, and HDI-related ECG changes.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients with solid tumors, including 11 patients with thyroid cancer were enrolled. Six dose levels were explored, and 7 mg/m(2) on days 1, 3, and 5 was identified as tolerable. No Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors-defined objective responses were recorded although 9 patients had stable disease a median 30 weeks (range, 21-112) including 6 with thyroid cancer a median of 33 weeks. PD studies detected acetylated histones in PBMCs and ECG changes beginning at low dose levels. Follow-up RAI scans in patients with RAI refractory thyroid cancer did not detect meaningful increases.
CONCLUSIONS: A romidepsin dose of 7 mg/m(2) administered on days 1, 3, and 5 was found tolerable and resulted in histone acetylation in PBMCs. Although there were no objective responses with romidepsin alone, this schedule may be useful for developing combination studies in solid tumors.},

Many statistical methods have been proposed for these trials, all of which are based on the assumption of a monotonic dose-toxicity curve. For single-agent trials, this is a valid assumption. In many trials, however, investigators are interested in finding the maximally tolerated dose based on escalating multiple cytotoxic agents. When there are multiple agents, monotonicity of the dose-toxicity curve is not clearly defined. In this article we present a design for phase I trials in which the toxicity probabilities follow a partial order, meaning that there are pairs of treatments for which the ordering of the toxicity probabilities is not known at the start of the trial. We compare the new design to existing methods for simple orders and investigate the properties of the design for two partial orders.},

	doi = {10.1177/1740774518792258},
	abstract = {Background/aims In the conduct of phase I trials, the limited use of innovative model-based designs in practice has led to an introduction of a class of "model-assisted" designs with the aim of effectively balancing the trade-off between design simplicity and performance. Prior to the recent surge of these designs, methods that allocated patients to doses based on isotonic toxicity probability estimates were proposed. Like model-assisted methods, isotonic designs allow investigators to avoid difficulties associated with pre-trial parametric specifications of model-based designs. The aim of this work is to take a fresh look at an isotonic design in light of the current landscape of model-assisted methods. Methods The isotonic phase I method of Conaway, Dunbar, and Peddada was proposed in 2004 and has been regarded primarily as a design for dose-finding in drug combinations. It has largely been overlooked in the single-agent setting. Given its strong simulation performance in application to more complex dose-finding problems, such as drug combinations and patient heterogeneity, as well as the recent development of user-friendly software to accompany the method, we take a fresh look at this design and compare it to a current model-assisted method. We generated operating characteristics of the Conaway-Dunbar-Peddada method using a new web application developed for simulating and implementing the design and compared it to the recently proposed Keyboard design that is based on toxicity probability intervals. Results The Conaway-Dunbar-Peddada method has better performance in terms of accuracy of dose recommendation and safety in patient allocation in 17 of 20 scenarios considered. The Conaway-Dunbar-Peddada method also allocated fewer patients to doses above the maximum tolerated dose than the Keyboard method in many of scenarios studied. Overall, the performance of the Conaway-Dunbar-Peddada method is strong when compared to the Keyboard method, making it a viable simple alternative to the model-assisted methods developed in recent years. Conclusion The Conaway-Dunbar-Peddada method does not rely on the specification and fitting of a parametric model for the entire dose-toxicity curve to estimate toxicity probabilities as other model-based designs do.

	abstract = {To determine if chemotherapy dose intensity influences treatment outcome in advanced ovarian cancer, all randomised studies of first line chemotherapy, published between 1975 and 1989, were analysed for relationships between planned dose intensity and (a) objective response and (b) median survival. Total dose intensity of each study regimen was calculated and a weighted regression model providing for systemic differences in response or survival among studies was utilised. Hence, treatment arms of different studies were never directly compared. In addition, relative dose intensities of individual drugs within combinations was similarly evaluated. The improvement in objective response rate when adding one unit of total dose intensity ranged between 12\% and 16\% depending on baseline response rate. The improvement in median survival when adding one unit of total dose intensity ranged between 2 and 4 months. One unit of total dose intensity corresponds to, for example, 20 mg m2 week of cisplatin, or 25 mg m2 week of doxorubicin, or 350 mg m2 week of cyclophosphamide. The analysis of individual drugs suggested that doxorubicin and the platinum compounds were about equally effective, with cyclophosphamide being less effective. The methodological benefits and limitations of the approach used and the implication of the results are discussed.},

Moreover, the increasingly common practice of treating an expansion cohort at a chosen MTD has undesirable consequences that may not be obvious.Patients and methodsWe review the phase I–II paradigm and the EffTox design, which utilizes both efficacy and toxicity to choose optimal doses for successive patient cohorts and find the optimal P2RD. We conduct a computer simulation study to compare the performance of the EffTox design with the traditional 3 + 3 design and the continuous reassessment method.ResultsBy accounting for the risk–benefit trade-off, the EffTox phase I–II design overcomes the limitations of conventional toxicity-based phase I designs. Numerical simulations show that the EffTox design has higher probabilities of identifying the optimal dose and treats more patients at the optimal dose.ConclusionsPhase I–II designs, such as the EffTox design, provide a coherent and efficient approach to finding the optimal P2RD by explicitly accounting for risk–benefit trade-offs underlying medical decisions.},

There are several strong motivations for combining different agents in a treatment: to induce the synergistic treatment effect, to increase the dose intensity with nonoverlapping toxicities, and to target different tumor cell susceptibilities. To accommodate this growing trend in clinical trials, we propose a Bayesian adaptive design for dose finding based on latent 2 x 2 tables. In the search for the maximum tolerated dose combination, we continuously update the posterior estimates for the unknown parameters associated with marginal probabilities and the correlation parameter based on the data from successive patients. By reordering the dose toxicity probabilities in the two-dimensional space, we assign each coming cohort of patients to the most appropriate dose combination. We conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of the proposed method under various practical scenarios. Finally, we illustrate our dose-finding procedure with a clinical trial of agent combinations at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.},

The development of combination regimens, while desirable, poses unique challenges. These include the selection of agents for combination therapy that may lead to improved efficacy while maintaining acceptable toxicity, the design of clinical trials that provide informative results for individual agents and combinations, and logistic and regulatory challenges. The phase I trial is often the initial step in the clinical evaluation of a combination regimen. In view of the importance of combination regimens and the challenges associated with developing them, the Clinical Trial Design (CTD) Task Force of the National Cancer Institute Investigational Drug Steering Committee developed a set of recommendations for the phase I development of a combination regimen. The first two recommendations focus on the scientific rationale and development plans for the combination regimen; subsequent recommendations encompass clinical design aspects. The CTD Task Force recommends that selection of the proposed regimens be based on a biologic or pharmacologic rationale supported by clinical and/or robust and validated preclinical evidence, and accompanied by a plan for subsequent development of the combination. The design of the phase I clinical trial should take into consideration the potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions as well as overlapping toxicity. Depending on the specific hypothesized interaction, the primary endpoint may be dose optimization, pharmacokinetics, and/or pharmacodynamics (i.e., biomarker).

	issn = {0277-6715},
	abstract = {Only with knowledge of the (prior) distribution of dose-response parameters in a population, can one determine both the initial dose of a drug for chronic administration to an individual (such as the dose producing a fixed degree of response in a fixed proportion of the population) and an appropriate subsequent (adjusted) dose (such as the dose yielding a desirable response according to the posterior parameter distribution, given an observed response to an initial dose). The currently FDA-sanctioned design for a dose-ranging study, the parallel-dose design, assigns just one of several doses to each patient. It does not provide good information on the distribution of individual dose-response parameters. A cross-over design assigns several dose levels to each patient. It therefore can provide better information, but does not resemble clinical practice. Consequently, study participants must be restricted to patients who can tolerate such non-therapeutic drug exposure, posing problems in extrapolation of study results to other types of patients. A titration or dose-escalation design begins all patients on placebo and, except for those patients assigned to a placebo-only group, escalates the dose for a patient at preset intervals only when clinical response at lower doses is inadequate. It both exposes patients to several dose levels and resembles good clinical practice, allowing study of a representative patient sample. We report here the simulation results of parameter estimation for the three designs when the data arise from complex and realistic dose-response models and/or with certain complications in study execution. The dose-escalation design clearly performs better overall than the parallel-dose design for the models considered here, and generally, just a little worse than the cross-over design. These results support the conclusion that for dose ranging, depending on the demands of the clinical situation, one should use either the cross-over or the dose-escalation design.},

To demonstrate the importance of rapid drug approval, we calculated life-years potentially saved if selected agents were approved more rapidly. As illustrative examples, we used 27 trials documenting improvements in survival. We multiplied improvement in median survival by numbers of patients dying annually and multiplied this by number of years from drug discovery until approval. For every year by which time to drug approval could have been shortened, there would have been a median number of life-years potentially saved of 79,920 worldwide per drug. Median number of life-years lost between time of drug discovery and approval was 1,020,900 per example. If we were able to use available opportunities to decrease the time required to take a drug from discovery to approval to 5 years, the median number of life-years saved per example would have been 523,890 worldwide. Various publications have identified opportunities to speed drug development without sacrificing patient safety. While many investigational drugs prove to be ineffective, some significantly prolong survival and/or reduce suffering.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) for high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Overall, 128 high-risk ALL patients at a median age of 26 years (range 18-56 years) at diagnosis received AHSCT between 1991-2008. Induction treatment was anthracycline-based in all patients. Conditioning regimen consisted of CAV (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, etoposide) in 125 patients whereas 3 subjects received cyclophosphamide and TBI (total body irradiation). Bone marrow was stored for 72 hours in 4°C and re-infused 24 hours after conditioning completion. Bone marrow was a source of stem cells in 119 patients, peripheral blood in 2 and 7 subjects received both bone marrow and peripheral blood.
RESULTS: With a median follow-up after AHSCT of 1.6 years (range 0.1-22.3 years), the probability of leukemia-free survival (LFS) for the whole group at 10 years was 27\% and 23\% at 20 years. Transplant-related mortality at 100 days after AHSCT was 3.2\%. There was a strong tendency for better LFS for MRD-negative patients if compared with patients who had positive or unknown MRD status at AHSCT (32\% vs 23\% and 25\%, respectively; p=0.06). There was no difference in LFS between B- and T-lineage ALL as well as between patients transplanted in first complete remission (CR1) and CR2. LFS at 10 years for patients with Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) ALL at transplant was 20\% and this was comparable with subjects with negative and missing Ph status (26\% and 28\%; p=0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of AHSCT for high-risk ALL remains unsatisfactory with low probability of long-term LFS.},

The mean minimum leukocyte count over the first three courses of the consolidation phase was used as the measure of hematological toxicity and ranged between 200 and 1,167/μl. The risk of relapse was significantly higher in patients with a mean minimum leukocyte count above the median of 433/μl (hazard ratio, 6.61; P=0.047).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rate of clearance of antileukemic agents differs by a factor of 3 to 10 among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We hypothesized that the outcome of treatment would be improved if doses were individualized to prevent low systemic exposure to the drugs in patients with fast drug clearance.
METHODS: We stratified and randomly assigned 182 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia to postremission regimens that included high-dose methotrexate and teniposide plus cytarabine. The doses of these drugs were based on body-surface area (in the conventional-therapy group) or the rates of clearance of the three medications in each patient (in the individualized-treatment group). In the individualized-treatment group, doses were increased in patients with rapid clearance and decreased in patients with very slow clearance.
RESULTS: Patients who received individualized doses had significantly fewer courses of treatment with systemic exposures below the target range than did patients who received conventional doses (P{\textless}0.001 for each medication). Among the patients with B-lineage leukemia, those who received individualized therapy had a significantly better outcome than those given conventional therapy (P=0.02); the mean (+/-SE) rates of continuous complete remission at five years were 76+/-6 percent and 66+/-7 percent, respectively. There was no significant difference between treatments for patients with T-lineage leukemia (P=0.54). In a proportional-hazards model, the time-dependent systemic exposure to methotrexate, but not to teniposide or cytarabine, was significantly related to the risk of early relapse in children with B-lineage leukemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjusting the dose of methotrexate to account for the patient's ability to clear the drug can improve the outcome in children with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia.},

	abstract = {Lymphodepletion chemotherapy followed by infusion of CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T) cells can be complicated by neurologic adverse events (AE) in patients with refractory B-cell malignancies. In 133 adults treated with CD19 CAR-T cells, we found that acute lymphoblastic leukemia, high CD19+ cells in bone marrow, high CAR-T cell dose, cytokine release syndrome, and preexisting neurologic comorbidities were associated with increased risk of neurologic AEs. Patients with severe neurotoxicity demonstrated evidence of endothelial activation, including disseminated intravascular coagulation, capillary leak, and increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. The permeable BBB failed to protect the cerebrospinal fluid from high concentrations of systemic cytokines, including IFNγ, which induced brain vascular pericyte stress and their secretion of endothelium-activating cytokines. Endothelial activation and multifocal vascular disruption were found in the brain of a patient with fatal neurotoxicity. Biomarkers of endothelial activation were higher before treatment in patients who subsequently developed grade ≥4 neurotoxicity.Significance: We provide a detailed clinical, radiologic, and pathologic characterization of neurotoxicity after CD19 CAR-T cells, and identify risk factors for neurotoxicity. We show endothelial dysfunction and increased BBB permeability in neurotoxicity and find that patients with evidence of endothelial activation before lymphodepletion may be at increased risk of neurotoxicity.

Separate CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations are transduced with lentivirus to express a CD19-directed CAR with a 4-1BB/CD3ζ endodomain. The CD4+ and CD8+ T cell fractions are expanded separately to a target CAR T cell dose and formulated / cryopreserved separately. Cultures are optimized for the unique biology of each phenotype. To minimize between-lot variance in cell health, the drug product is held at constant volume with a tight range of viable cell concentrations (CD8+: median 31x10$^{\textrm{6}}$ cells/mL, IQR 28-40 x10$^{\textrm{6}}$ cells/mL, N=38; CD4+: median 35x10$^{\textrm{6}}$ cells/mL, IQR 31-40x10$^{\textrm{6}}$, N=36). Additionally, JCAR017 cell health is assessed by measuring post-thaw cell surface Annexin V and active intracellular Caspase 3. The median \% Annexin V+ is 11\%, IQR 9-18\% (N=33) of CD8+CAR+ T cells and 10\%, IQR 8-17\% (N=31) of CD4+CAR+ T cells. Caspase 3 expression is similar to Annexin V. \textit{In vitro} antigen-specific cytokine accumulation and intracellular cytokine bioassays show similar low variance between lots for multiple cytokines. For example, after CD19 stimulation TNFα production has a tight range with relative standard deviation (RSD) of 37\% for CD4+CAR+ T cells (N=59) and 51\% for CD8+CAR+ T cells (N=61). Details will be presented and compared to a similar CAR T cell product without a defined composition.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}JCAR017 is administered in precise quantities of CD4+CAR+ and CD8+CAR+ T cells to patients. In an ongoing, multicenter, Phase 1 trial (TRANSCEND NHL 001), JCAR017 is administered as a flat dose at dose level 1 (DL1) of 5×10$^{\textrm{7}}$ CAR+ T cells (2.5x10$^{\textrm{7}}$ CD4+CAR+ T cells and 2.5x10$^{\textrm{7}}$ CD8+CAR+ T cells) or at dose level 2 (DL2) 10×10$^{\textrm{7}}$ CAR+ T cells (5x10$^{\textrm{7}}$ CD4+CAR+ T cells and 5x10$^{\textrm{7}}$ CD8+CAR+ T cells). At the site, JCAR017 is thawed and a patient-specific volume is withdrawn and administered. The range of administered dose was found to have low variability: 2.4-2.7x10$^{\textrm{7}}$ (target ±8\%) CD4+CAR+ or CD8+CAR+ T cells at DL1 (N=48) and 4.6-5.1x10$^{\textrm{7}}$ (target ±8\%) CD4+CAR+ or CD8+CAR+ T cells at DL2 (N=20). After administration to the patient, JCAR017 has a slow expansion profile with peak expansion at approximately 15 days with low rates of severe CRS and NT and an emerging dose:response relationship.

Three aspects of JCAR017 manufacturing contribute to the low variability between lots and encouraging clinical profile: 1) a precise, consistent flat dose of administered CD4+ and CD8+ CAR T cells; 2) control and optimization of CD4 and CD8 T cell culture conditions that results in low variability of cytokine production (e.g. IL-2, TNFα and IFNγ, etc.); and 3) constant formulation and volume of drug product that contributes to consistent cell health. The process control strategy and defined cellular composition of JCAR017 could contribute to the lower rates of CRS and NT than reported for other CD19-targeted CAR T cell products in clinical development for NHL.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Disclosures{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}\textbf{Ramsborg: }\textit{Juno Therapeutics:} Employment, Equity Ownership, Patents \&amp; Royalties. \textbf{Guptill: }\textit{Juno Therapeutics:} Employment, Equity Ownership. \textbf{Weber: }\textit{Juno Therapeutics:} Employment, Equity Ownership. \textbf{Christin: }\textit{Juno Therapeutics:} Employment, Equity Ownership. \textbf{Larson: }\textit{Juno Therapeutics:} Employment, Equity Ownership, Patents \&amp; Royalties. \textbf{Lewis: }\textit{Juno Therapeutics:} Employment, Equity Ownership. \textbf{Mallaney: }\textit{Juno Therapeutics:} Employment, Equity Ownership. \textbf{Bowen: }\textit{Juno Therapeutics:} Employment, Equity Ownership. \textbf{Higham: }\textit{Juno Therapeutics:} Equity Ownership. \textbf{Albertson: }\textit{Juno Therapeutics:} Employment, Equity Ownership, Patents \&amp; Royalties.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	doi = {10.1111/bcp.12906},
	abstract = {AIM: High dose melphalan (HDM) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) retains a central role in the treatment of myeloma. The aim of this study was to determine whether HDM exposure (area under the concentration vs. time curve, AUC), is significantly associated with transplant outcomes.
METHODS: Melphalan concentrations were measured in six to 11 plasma samples collected after HDM (median 192 mg m(-) (2) ) to determine melphalan AUC for a total of 114 patients. Binary logistic regression was used to assess whether melphalan AUC was associated with severe (≥ grade 3) oral mucositis. Multivariate Cox regression was used to assess whether melphalan AUC was significantly associated with time to progression, progression-free survival and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Melphalan AUC ranged from 4.9 to 24.6 mg l(-1)  h, median 12.84 mg l(-1) h. Melphalan AUC above the median was a risk factor for severe mucositis (HR 1.21, 95\% CI 1.06, 1.38, P = 0.004) but was also associated with significantly improved overall survival (OS) (HR 0.40, 95\% CI 0.20, 0.81, P = 0.001), with an estimated median survival of 8.50 years vs. 5.38 years for high vs. low AUC groups. Multivariate analysis did not identify melphalan AUC as being significantly associated with time to progression or progression-free survival.
CONCLUSIONS: This large scale pharmacodynamic analysis of HDM demonstrates that high melphalan exposure is associated with improved survival, with an acceptable increase in transplant toxicity. These results suggest studies targeting a higher AUC are warranted in patients undergoing HDM and ASCT for myeloma.},

	abstract = {Computational oncology is a generic term that encompasses any form of computer-based modelling relating to tumour biology and cancer therapy. Mathematical modelling can be used to probe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics relationships of the available anticancer agents in order to improve treatment. As a result of the ever-growing numbers of druggable molecular targets and possible drug combinations, obtaining an optimal toxicity-efficacy balance is an increasingly complex task. Consequently, standard empirical approaches to optimizing drug dosing and scheduling in patients are now of limited utility; mathematical modelling can substantially advance this practice through improved rationalization of therapeutic strategies. The implementation of mathematical modelling tools is an emerging trend, but remains largely insufficient to meet clinical needs; at the bedside, anticancer drugs continue to be prescribed and administered according to standard schedules. To shift the therapeutic paradigm towards personalized care, precision medicine in oncology requires powerful new resources for both researchers and clinicians. Mathematical modelling is an attractive approach that could help to refine treatment modalities at all phases of research and development, and in routine patient care. Reviewing preclinical and clinical examples, we highlight the current achievements and limitations with regard to computational modelling of drug regimens, and discuss the potential future implementation of this strategy to achieve precision medicine in oncology.},

	abstract = {Docetaxel, a novel anticancer agent, was given to 26 patients by short i.v. infusion (1-2 h) at various dose levels (70-115 mg/m2, the maximum tolerated dose) during 2 phase I studies. Two population analyses, one using NONMEM (nonlinear mixed-effect modeling) and the other using NPML (nonparametric maximum-likelihood), were performed sequentially to determine the structural model; estimate the mean population parameters, including clearance (Cl) and interindividual variability; and find influences of demographic covariates on them. Nine covariates were included in the analyses: age, height, weight, body surface area, sex, performance status, presence of liver metastasis, dose level, and type of formulation. A three-compartment model gave the best fit to the data, and the final NONMEM regression model for Cl was Cl = BSA(Theta1 + Theta02 x AGE), expressing Cl (in liters per hour) directly as a function of body surface area. Only these two covariates were considered in the NPML analysis to confirm the results found by NONMEM. Using NONMEM [for a patient with mean AGE (52.3 years) and mean BSA (1.68 m2)] and NPML, docetaxel Cl was estimated to be 35.6 l/h (21.2 lh-1 m-2) and 37.2 l/h with interpatient coefficients of variations (CVs) of 17.4\% and 24.8\%, respectively. The intraindividual CV was estimated at 23.8\% by NONMEM; the corresponding variability was fixed in NPML in an additive Gaussian variance error model with a 20\% CV. Discrepancies were found in the mean volume at steady state (Vss; 83.21 for NPML versus 1241 for NONMEM) and in terminal half-lives, notably the mean t1/2 gamma, which was shorter as determined by NPML (7.89 versus 12.2 h), although the interindividual CV was 89.1\% and 62.7\% for Vss and t1/2 gamma, respectively. However, the NPML-estimated probability density function (pdf) of t1/2 gamma was bimodal (5 and 11.4 h), probably due to the imbalance of the data. Both analyses suggest a similar magnitude of mean Cl decrease with small BSA and advanced age.},

	abstract = {Chemo-resistance is one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths. Here we used single-cell transcriptomics to investigate divergent modes of chemo-resistance in tumor cells. We observed that higher degree of phenotypic intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) favors selection of pre-existing drug-resistant cells, whereas phenotypically homogeneous cells engage covert epigenetic mechanisms to trans-differentiate under drug-selection. This adaptation was driven by selection-induced gain of H3K27ac marks on bivalently poised resistance-associated chromatin, and therefore not expressed in the treatment-naïve setting. Mechanistic interrogation of this phenomenon revealed that drug-induced adaptation was acquired upon the loss of stem factor SOX2, and a concomitant gain of SOX9. Strikingly we observed an enrichment of SOX9 at drug-induced H3K27ac sites, suggesting that tumor evolution could be driven by stem cell-switch-mediated epigenetic plasticity. Importantly, JQ1 mediated inhibition of BRD4 could reverse drug-induced adaptation. These results provide mechanistic insights into the modes of therapy-induced cellular plasticity and underscore the use of epigenetic inhibitors in targeting tumor evolution.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metronomic oral vinorelbine is effective in metastatic NSCLC and malignant pleural mesothelioma, but all the studies published thus far were based upon a variety of empirical and possibly suboptimal schedules, with inconsistent results. Mathematical modelling showed by simulation that a new metronomic protocol could lead to a better safety and efficacy profile.
DESIGN: This phase Ia/Ib trial was designed to confirm safety (phase Ia) and evaluate efficacy (phase Ib) of a new metronomic oral vinorelbine schedule. Patients with metastatic NSCLC or malignant pleural mesothelioma in whom standard treatments failed and who exhibited ECOG performance status 0-2 and adequate organ function will be eligible. Our mathematical PK-PD model suggested an alternative weekly D1, D2 and D4 schedule (named Vinorelbine Theoretical Protocol) with a respective dose of 60, 30 and 60 mg. Trial recruitment will be two-staged, as 12 patients are planned to participate in phase Ia to confirm safety and consolidate the calibration of the model parameters. Depending on the phase Ia results and after a favourable decision from a consultative committee, the extension phase (phase Ib) will be an efficacy study including 20 patients who will receive the Optimal Vinorelbine Theoretical Protocol. The primary endpoint is the tolerance (assessed by CTC v4.0) for the phase Ia and the objective response according to RECIST 1.1 for phase Ib. An ancillary study on circulating angiogenesis biomarkers will be a subproject of the trial.
DISCUSSION: This ongoing trial is the first to prospectively test a mathematically optimized schedule in metronomic chemotherapy. As such, this trial can be considered as a proof-of-concept study demonstrating the feasibility to run a computational-driven protocol to ensure an optimal efficacy/toxicity balance in patients with cancer.

	abstract = {Radiotherapy is a major part in the treatment of most common cancers, but many patients experience local recurrence with metastatic disease. In evaluating response biomarkers, we found that low doses of fractionated radiotherapy led to PD-L1 upregulation on tumor cells in a variety of syngeneic mouse models of cancer. Notably, fractionated radiotherapy delivered in combination with αPD-1 or αPD-L1 mAbs generated efficacious CD8(+) T-cell responses that improved local tumor control, long-term survival, and protection against tumor rechallenge. These favorable outcomes were associated with induction of a tumor antigen-specific memory immune response. Mechanistic investigations showed that IFNγ produced by CD8(+) T cells was responsible for mediating PD-L1 upregulation on tumor cells after delivery of fractionated radiotherapy. Scheduling of anti-PD-L1 mAb was important for therapeutic outcome, with concomitant but not sequential administration with fractionated radiotherapy required to improve survival. Taken together, our results reveal the mechanistic basis for an adaptive response by tumor cells that mediates resistance to fractionated radiotherapy and its treatment failure. With attention to scheduling, combination immunoradiotherapy with radiotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 signaling blockade may offer an immediate strategy for clinical evaluation to improve treatment outcomes.},

A Bayes estimate of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) curve is proposed at the conclusion of the trial for continuous doses or a set of MTDs is determined in the case of discrete dose levels. We evaluate design operating characteristics in terms of safety of the trial and percent of dose recommendation at dose combination neighborhoods around the true MTD under various model generated scenarios and misspecification.

	abstract = {Drug-tolerant "persister" tumor cells underlie emergence of drug-resistant clones and contribute to relapse and disease progression. Here we report that resistance to the BCL-2 targeting drug ABT-199 in models of mantle cell lymphoma and double-hit lymphoma evolves from outgrowth of persister clones displaying loss of 18q21 amplicons that harbor BCL2. Further, persister status is generated via adaptive super-enhancer remodeling that reprograms transcription and offers opportunities for overcoming ABT-199 resistance. Notably, pharmacoproteomic and pharmacogenomic screens revealed that persisters are vulnerable to inhibition of the transcriptional machinery and especially to inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), which is essential for the transcriptional reprogramming that drives and sustains ABT-199 resistance. Thus, transcription-targeting agents offer new approaches to disable drug resistance in B-cell lymphomas.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship of pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics (PK) and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: PK dependencies in OS were evaluated across three pembrolizumab studies of either 200 mg or 2 to 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W). Kaplan-Meier plots of OS, stratified by dose, exposure, and baseline clearance (CL0), were assessed per indication and study. A Cox proportional hazards model was implemented to explore imbalances of typical prognostic factors in high/low NSCLC CL0 subgroups.
RESULTS: A total of 1,453 subjects were included: 340 with pembrolizumab-treated melanoma, 804 with pembrolizumab-treated NSCLC, and 309 with docetaxel-treated NSCLC. OS was dose independent from 2 to 10 mg/kg for pembrolizumab-treated melanoma [HR = 0.98; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.94-1.02] and NSCLC (HR = 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.95-1.01); however, a strong CL0-OS association was identified for both cancer types (unadjusted melanoma HR = 2.56; 95\% CI, 1.72-3.80 and NSCLC HR = 2.64; 95\% CI, 1.94-3.57). Decreased OS in subjects with higher pembrolizumab CL0 paralleled disease severity markers associated with end-stage cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome. Correction for baseline prognostic factors did not fully attenuate the CL0-OS association (multivariate-adjusted CL0 HR = 1.64; 95\% CI, 1.06-2.52 for melanoma and HR = 1.88; 95\% CI, 1.22-2.89 for NSCLC).
CONCLUSIONS: These data support the lack of dose or exposure dependency in pembrolizumab OS for melanoma and NSCLC between 2 and 10 mg/kg. An association of pembrolizumab CL0 with OS potentially reflects catabolic activity as a marker of disease severity versus a direct PK-related impact of pembrolizumab on efficacy. Similar data from other trials suggest such patterns of exposure-response confounding may be a broader phenomenon generalizable to antineoplastic mAbs.See related commentary by Coss et al., p. 5787.},

	abstract = {Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as anti–PD-1 (programmed cell death 1) or anti–PD-L1 (programmed cell death 1 ligand 1), have proved effective in treating many cancers, patients receiving ICIs may experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Little evidence exists on the safety of resuming these treatments after an irAE.To investigate the safety of a rechallenge with anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1 immunotherapies after an irAE.This cohort study of the safety of an ICI rechallenge involved consecutive adult patients (n = 93) who were referred to the ImmunoTOX assessment board at the Gustave Roussy cancer center in Villejuif, France, between August 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017. Data were analyzed from May 28 to November 25, 2018.Incidence of a second irAE in patients who had a readministration of an anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1 inhibitor after an initial grade 2 or higher irAE. Characteristics of the patients and the irAEs were reviewed, and the primary end point was the rate of occurrence of second irAEs.A total of 93 patients were included, among whom 48 (52\%) were female, and the median (range) age was 62.5 (33-85) years. The main cancer types or tumor sites were melanoma (31 [33\%]), lung (15 [16\%]), colorectal (8 [9\%]), and lymphoma (8 [9\%]). For the initial irAE, 43 grade 2 events (46\%), 36 grade 3 events (39\%), and 14 grade 4 events (15\%) were found, presenting primarily as hepatitis (17 [18\%]), skin toxic effect (14 [15\%]), pneumonitis (13 [14\%]), colitis (11 [12\%]), or arthralgia (7 [7.5\%]). Forty patients (43\%) were rechallenged with the same anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1 agent. The rechallenged and non-rechallenged groups did not differ in terms of median (range) age (61 [34-84] years vs 63 [33-85] years; P = .37), time to initial irAE (5 [1-40] treatment cycles vs 3 [1-22] treatment cycles; P = .32), irAE severity (grade 2: 18 [47.5\%] vs 27 [51\%]; grades 3-4: 22 [52.5\%] vs 26 [49\%]; P = .70), or steroid use (17 [42.5\%] vs 32 [60\%]; P = .09). With a median follow-up period of 14 months, the same irAE or a different irAE occurred in 22 patients (55\%). Shorter time to the initial irAE was linked to the occurrence of a second irAE (9 vs 15 weeks; P = .04). The second irAEs were not found to be more severe than the first.The risk-reward ratio for an anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1 rechallenge appears to be acceptable, although these patients require close monitoring; further investigation into rechallenge conditions through a prospective clinical trial is needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phase I trials often include a dose expansion cohort (DEC), in which additional patients are treated at the estimated maximum tolerated dose (MTD) after dose escalation, with the goal of ensuring that data are available from more than six patients at a single dose level. However, protocols do not always detail how, or even if, the additional toxicity data will be used to reanalyze the MTD or whether observed toxicity in the DEC will warrant changing the assigned dose. A DEC strategy has not been statistically justified.
METHODS: We conducted a simulation study of two phase I designs: the "3+3" and the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM). We quantified how many patients are assigned the true MTD using a 10 to 20 patient DEC and how a sensible reanalysis using the DEC changes the probability of selecting the true MTD. We compared these results with those from an equivalently sized larger CRM that does not include a DEC.
RESULTS: With either the 3+3 or CRM, reanalysis with the DEC increased the probability of identifying the true MTD. However, a large CRM without a DEC was more likely to identify the true MTD while still treating 10 or 15 patients at this dose level.
CONCLUSIONS: Where feasible, a CRM design with no explicit DEC is preferred to designs that fix a dose for all patients in a DEC.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the limited efficacy observed with single agents, there is growing interest in Phase I clinical trial designs that allow for identification of the maximum tolerated combination of two agents.
PURPOSE: Existing parametric designs may suffer from over- or under-parameterization. Thus, we have designed a nonparametric approach that can be easily understood and implemented for combination trials.
METHODS: We propose a two-stage adaptive biased coin design that extends existing methods for single-agent trials to dual-agent dose-finding trials. The basic idea of our design is to divide the entire trial into two stages and apply the biased coin design, with modification, in each stage.
RESULTS: We compare the operating characteristics of our design to four competing parametric approaches via simulation in several numerical examples. Under all simulation scenarios we have examined, our method performs well in terms of identification of the maximum tolerated combination and allocation of patients relative to the performance of its competitors.
LIMITATIONS: In our design, stopping rule criteria and the distribution of the total sample size among the two stages are context-dependent, and both need careful consideration before adopting our design in practice. Efficacy is not a part of the dose-assignment algorithm, nor used to define the maximum tolerated combination.
CONCLUSION: Our design inherits the favorable statistical properties of the biased coin design, is competitive with existing designs, and promotes patient safety by limiting patient exposure to toxic combinations whenever possible.},

	doi = {10.1177/1740774518772309},
	abstract = {Background/Aims The goal of phase I clinical trials for cytotoxic agents is to find the maximum dose with an acceptable risk of severe toxicity. The most common designs for these dose-finding trials use a binary outcome indicating whether a patient had a dose-limiting toxicity. However, a patient may experience multiple toxicities, with each toxicity assigned an ordinal severity score. The binary response is then obtained by dichotomizing a patient's richer set of data. We contribute to the growing literature on new models to exploit this richer toxicity data, with the goal of improving the efficiency in estimating the maximum tolerated dose. Methods We develop three new, related models that make use of the total number of dose-limiting and low-level toxicities a patient experiences. We use these models to estimate the probability of having at least one dose-limiting toxicity as a function of dose. In a simulation study, we evaluate how often our models select the true maximum tolerated dose, and we compare our models with the continual reassessment method, which uses binary data. Results Across a variety of simulation settings, we find that our models compare well against the continual reassessment method in terms of selecting the true optimal dose. In particular, one of our models which uses dose-limiting and low-level toxicity counts beats or ties the other models, including the continual reassessment method, in all scenarios except the one in which the true optimal dose is the highest dose available. We also find that our models, when not selecting the true optimal dose, tend to err by picking lower, safer doses, while the continual reassessment method errs more toward toxic doses. Conclusion Using dose-limiting and low-level toxicity counts, which are easily obtained from data already routinely collected, is a promising way to improve the efficiency in finding the true maximum tolerated dose in phase I trials.},

The key involvement of angiogenesis in tumor growth and metastasis has started to redefine chemotherapy and new protocols have emerged. Metronomic chemotherapy, which is intended to prevent tumor angiogenesis, is based on more frequent and low-dose drug administrations compared with conventional chemotherapy. The potential of metronomic chemotherapy was revealed in animal models a decade ago and the efficacy of this approach has been confirmed in the clinic. In the past 5 years, multiple clinical trials have investigated the safety and efficacy of metronomic chemotherapy in a variety of human cancers. While the results have been variable, clinical studies have shown that these new treatment protocols represent an interesting alternative for either primary systemic therapy or maintenance therapy. We review the latest clinical trials of metronomic chemotherapy in adult and pediatric cancer patients. Accumulating evidence suggests that the efficacy of such treatment may not only rely on anti-angiogenic activity. Potential new mechanisms of action, such as restoration of anticancer immune response and induction of tumor dormancy are discussed. Finally, we highlight the research efforts that need to be made to facilitate the optimal development of metronomic chemotherapy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cells targeting CD19 have shown activity in case series of patients with acute and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and B-cell lymphomas, but feasibility, toxicity, and response rates of consecutively enrolled patients treated with a consistent regimen and assessed on an intention-to-treat basis have not been reported. We aimed to define feasibility, toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, response rate, and biological correlates of response in children and young adults with refractory B-cell malignancies treated with CD19-CAR T cells.
METHODS: This phase 1, dose-escalation trial consecutively enrolled children and young adults (aged 1-30 years) with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Autologous T cells were engineered via an 11-day manufacturing process to express a CD19-CAR incorporating an anti-CD19 single-chain variable fragment plus TCR zeta and CD28 signalling domains. All patients received fludarabine and cyclophosphamide before a single infusion of CD19-CAR T cells. Using a standard 3 + 3 design to establish the maximum tolerated dose, patients received either 1 × 10(6) CAR-transduced T cells per kg (dose 1), 3 × 10(6) CAR-transduced T cells per kg (dose 2), or the entire CAR T-cell product if sufficient numbers of cells to meet the assigned dose were not generated. After the dose-escalation phase, an expansion cohort was treated at the maximum tolerated dose. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01593696.
FINDINGS: Between July 2, 2012, and June 20, 2014, 21 patients (including eight who had previously undergone allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation) were enrolled and infused with CD19-CAR T cells. 19 received the prescribed dose of CD19-CAR T cells, whereas the assigned dose concentration could not be generated for two patients (90\% feasible). All patients enrolled were assessed for response. The maximum tolerated dose was defined as 1 × 10(6) CD19-CAR T cells per kg. All toxicities were fully reversible, with the most severe being grade 4 cytokine release syndrome that occurred in three (14\%) of 21 patients (95\% CI 3·0-36·3). The most common non-haematological grade 3 adverse events were fever (nine [43\%] of 21 patients), hypokalaemia (nine [43\%] of 21 patients), fever and neutropenia (eight [38\%] of 21 patients), and cytokine release syndrome (three [14\%) of 21 patients).
INTERPRETATION: CD19-CAR T cell therapy is feasible, safe, and mediates potent anti-leukaemic activity in children and young adults with chemotherapy-resistant B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. All toxicities were reversible and prolonged B-cell aplasia did not occur.

	abstract = {We present a new adaptive Bayesian method for dose-finding in phase I clinical trials based on both response and toxicity. Although clinical responses are usually rare in phase I cancer trials, molecularly targeted therapy may make clinical responses more likely. In addition, biological responses may be common. Thus responses may be frequent enough to help decide how aggressive a phase I escalation should be. The model assumes that response and toxicity events happen depending on respective dose thresholds for the individual, assuming that the thresholds jointly follow a bivariate log-normal distribution or a mixture. The design utilizes prior information about the population threshold distribution as well as accumulated data. The next dose is assigned to maximize a patient-oriented expected utility integrated over the current posterior distribution. The design is evaluated through simulation with population parameters equaling estimates from early Gleevec trials. This exercise provides evidence for the value of the use of the proposed design for future clinical trials.},

	doi = {10.1177/1740774514547397},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The efficacy-toxicity trade-off based design is a practical Bayesian phase I-II dose-finding methodology. Because the design's performance is very sensitive to prior hyperparameters and the shape of the target trade-off contour, specifying these two design elements properly is essential.
PURPOSE: The goals are to provide a method that uses elicited mean outcome probabilities to derive a prior that is neither overly informative nor overly disperse, and practical guidelines for specifying the target trade-off contour.
METHODS: A general algorithm is presented that determines prior hyperparameters using least squares penalized by effective sample size. Guidelines for specifying the trade-off contour are provided. These methods are illustrated by a clinical trial in advanced prostate cancer. A new version of the efficacy-toxicity program is provided for implementation.
RESULTS: Together, the algorithm and guidelines provide substantive improvements in the design's operating characteristics.
LIMITATIONS: The method requires a substantial number of elicited values and design parameters, and computer simulations are required to obtain an acceptable design.
CONCLUSION: The two key improvements greatly enhance the efficacy-toxicity design's practical usefulness and are straightforward to implement using the updated computer program. The algorithm for determining prior hyperparameters to ensure a specified level of informativeness is general, and may be applied to models other than that underlying the efficacy-toxicity method.},

                     usually based on survival time or progression free survival time. It is widely recognized that this paradigm has many flaws. A recent approach combines the first two phases by conducting a phase I-II trial, which chooses an optimal dose based on both efficacy and toxicity, and evaluation of A at the selected optimal phase I-II dose then is done in a phase III trial. This paper proposes a new design paradigm, motivated by the possibility that the optimal phase I-II dose may not maximize mean survival time with A. We propose a hybridized design, which we call phase I-II/III, that combines phase I-II and phase III by allowing the chosen optimal phase I-II dose of A to be re-optimized based on survival time data from phase I-II patients and the first portion of phase III. The phase I-II/III design uses adaptive randomization in phase I-II, and relies on a mixture model for the survival time distribution as a function of efficacy, toxicity, and dose. A simulation study is presented to evaluate the phase I-II/III design and compare it to the usual approach that does not re-optimize the dose of A in phase III.},

A parametric model is assumed for the probability of toxicity as a function of the two doses. Informative priors for parameters characterizing the single-agent toxicity probability curves are either elicited from the physician(s) planning the trial or obtained from historical data, and vague priors are assumed for parameters characterizing two-agent interactions. A method for eliciting the single-agent parameter priors is described. The design is applied to a trial of gemcitabine and cyclophosphamide, and a simulation study is presented.},

	abstract = {An early phase clinical trial is the first step in evaluating the effects in humans of a potential new anti-disease agent or combination of agents. Usually called "phase I" or "phase I/II" trials, these experiments typically have the nominal scientific goal of determining an acceptable dose, most often based on adverse event probabilities. This arose from a tradition of phase I trials to evaluate cytotoxic agents for treating cancer, although some methods may be applied in other medical settings, such as treatment of stroke or immunological diseases. Most modern statistical designs for early phase trials include model-based, outcome-adaptive decision rules that choose doses for successive patient cohorts based on data from previous patients in the trial. Such designs have seen limited use in clinical practice, however, due to their complexity, the requirement of intensive, computer-based data monitoring, and the medical community's resistance to change. Still, many actual applications of model-based outcome-adaptive designs have been remarkably successful in terms of both patient benefit and scientific outcome. In this paper, I will review several Bayesian early phase trial designs that were tailored to accommodate specific complexities of the treatment regime and patient outcomes in particular clinical settings.},

Examples include maximizing effective treatment of patients in the trial, maximizing information about the slope of a dose–response curve, minimizing costs, minimizing the number of patients treated, minimizing the length of the trial and combinations of these desiderata. They also include standard frequentist operating characteristics when these are important considerations. Posterior probabilities are updated via Bayes’ theorem on the basis of accumulating data. These are used to effect modifications of the trial’s course, including stopping accrual, extending accrual beyond that originally planned, dropping treatment arms, adding arms, etc. An important aspect of the approach I advocate is modeling the relationship between a trial’s primary endpoint and early indications of patient performance—auxiliary endpoints. This has several highly desirable consequences. One is that it improves the efficiency of adaptive trials because information is available sooner than otherwise.},

The historical development of trials is briefly reviewed here, as are multifarious pressures and problems faced by those involved with clinical trials today. These challenges include recruitment difficulties, the emerging role of patient support groups, and legal threats over informed consent, to name three. Fundamentally, they reflect an overall shift towards patient-centred, individual ethics. I suggest many problems may be overcome by increased implementation of hitherto neglected, data-dependent designs for clinical trials. Over a dozen arguments against their use are countered, primarily through ethical considerations. Benefits and costs of refining clinical trials strategy are explored hypothetically under enhanced use of such 'learn-as-you-go' designs, in contrast to traditional, equal-allocation, fixed-sample-size and frequentist-based designs. These latter methods mirror crop field trials in which one cannot make scientific progress until after gathering objective data at harvest time. Some attempts to alleviate certain problems, such as Zelen randomization to boost recruitment, or over-reliance on 'large and simple trials' to detect moderate-sized treatment effects, are discussed and found inadequate. A proposal for wider discussion is made to assist the selective introduction of 'small and complex trials,' which could simultaneously expedite medical research, satisfy the concerns of regulators, statisticians, and doctors alike, and help address the growing demands of 21st-century patients.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, drug development has evaluated dose, safety, activity, and comparative benefit in a sequence of phases using trial designs and endpoints specifically devised for each phase. Innovations in drug development seek to consolidate the phases and rapidly expand accrual with "seamless" trial designs. Although consolidation and rapid accrual may yield efficiencies, widespread use of seamless first-in-human (FiH) trials without careful consideration of objectives, statistical analysis plans, or trial oversight raises concerns. A working group formed by the National Cancer Institute convened to consider and discuss opportunities and challenges for such trials as well as encourage responsible use of these designs. We reviewed all abstracts presented at American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meetings from 2010 to 2017 for FiH trials enrolling at least 100 patients. We identified 1786 early-phase trials enrolling 57 559 adult patients. Fifty-one of the trials (2.9\%) investigated 50 investigational new drugs, were seamless, and accounted for 14.6\% of the total patients. The seamless trials included a median of 3 (range = 1-13) expansion cohorts. The overall risk of clinically significant treatment-related adverse events (grade 3-4) was 49.1\% (range = 0.0-100\%), and seven studies reported at least one toxic death. Rapid expansion of FiH trials may lead to earlier drug approval and corresponding widespread patient access to active therapeutics. Nevertheless, seamless designs must adhere to established ethical, scientific, and statistical standards. Protocols should include prospectively planned analyses of efficacy in disease- or biomarker-defined cohorts of sufficient rigor to support accelerated approval.},

Doses are selected for successive patient cohorts based on a set of efficacy-toxicity trade-off contours that partition the two-dimensional outcome probability domain. Priors are established by solving for hyperparameters that optimize the fit of the model to elicited mean outcome probabilities. For trinary outcomes, the new algorithm is compared to the method of Thall and Russell (1998, Biometrics 54, 251-264) by application to a trial of rapid treatment for ischemic stroke. The bivariate binary outcome case is illustrated by a trial of graft-versus-host disease treatment in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

This article describes a Bayesian outcome-adaptive method for determining the best dose of an experimental agent and explains how this method was used to design a dose-finding trial for tPA in childhood.
METHODS: The method assigns doses to successive cohorts of patients on the basis of each dose's desirability, quantified in terms of the tradeoff between efficacy and toxicity. The tradeoff function is constructed from several pairs of equally desirable (efficacy, toxicity) probabilities specified by the physicians planning the trial. Each cohort's dose is chosen adaptively, based on dose-outcome data from the patients treated previously in the trial, to optimize the efficacy-toxicity tradeoff. Application of the method to design the tPA trial is described, including a computer simulation study to establish design properties. A hypothetical cohort-by-cohort example is given to illustrate how the method works during trial conduct.
RESULTS: Because only a dose that is both safe and efficacious may be selected and the method combines phase I and phase II by integrating efficacy and toxicity to choose doses, it avoids the more time-consuming and expensive conventional approach of conducting a phase I trial based on toxicity alone followed by a phase II trial based on efficacy alone. This is especially useful in settings with low accrual rates, such as trials of tPA for pediatric acute ischemic stroke.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor alectinib recently showed superior efficacy compared to the first-generation ALK inhibitor crizotinib in advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC, establishing alectinib as the new standard first-line therapy. Brigatinib, another second-generation ALK inhibitor, has shown substantial activity in patients with crizotinib-refractory ALK-positive NSCLC; however, its activity in the alectinib-refractory setting is unknown.
METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective study was performed at three institutions. Patients were eligible if they had advanced, alectinib-refractory ALK-positive NSCLC and were treated with brigatinib. Medical records were reviewed to determine clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were eligible for this study. Confirmed objective responses to brigatinib were observed in 3 of 18 patients (17\%) with measurable disease. Nine patients (50\%) had stable disease on brigatinib. The median progression-free survival was 4.4 months (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8-5.6 months) with a median duration of treatment of 5.7 months (95\% CI: 1.8-6.2 months). Among 9 patients in this study who underwent post-alectinib/pre-brigatinib biopsies, 5 had an ALK I1171X or V1180L resistance mutation; of these, 1 had a confirmed partial response and 3 had stable disease on brigatinib. One patient had an ALK G1202R mutation in a post-alectinib/pre-brigatinib biopsy, and had progressive disease as the best overall response to brigatinib.
CONCLUSIONS: Brigatinib has limited clinical activity in alectinib-refractory ALK-positive NSCLC. Additional studies are needed to establish biomarkers of response to brigatinib and to identify effective therapeutic options for alectinib-resistant ALK-positive NSCLC patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a single-center phase 1-2a study, the anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel produced high rates of complete remission and was associated with serious but mainly reversible toxic effects in children and young adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
METHODS: We conducted a phase 2, single-cohort, 25-center, global study of tisagenlecleucel in pediatric and young adult patients with CD19+ relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL. The primary end point was the overall remission rate (the rate of complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) within 3 months.
RESULTS: For this planned analysis, 75 patients received an infusion of tisagenlecleucel and could be evaluated for efficacy. The overall remission rate within 3 months was 81\%, with all patients who had a response to treatment found to be negative for minimal residual disease, as assessed by means of flow cytometry. The rates of event-free survival and overall survival were 73\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 60 to 82) and 90\% (95\% CI, 81 to 95), respectively, at 6 months and 50\% (95\% CI, 35 to 64) and 76\% (95\% CI, 63 to 86) at 12 months. The median duration of remission was not reached. Persistence of tisagenlecleucel in the blood was observed for as long as 20 months. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel occurred in 73\% of patients. The cytokine release syndrome occurred in 77\% of patients, 48\% of whom received tocilizumab. Neurologic events occurred in 40\% of patients and were managed with supportive care, and no cerebral edema was reported.
CONCLUSIONS: In this global study of CAR T-cell therapy, a single infusion of tisagenlecleucel provided durable remission with long-term persistence in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL, with transient high-grade toxic effects.

	doi = {10.1016/j.jtho.2019.04.028},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Rare cases of early onset pulmonary events (EOPEs) occurring within days of starting brigatinib have been reported (incidence 3-6\% using the recommended 90mg for 7 days then 180mg step-up dosing regimen). Current prescribing information suggests dose interruption then dose reduction for grade 1-2 events, and discontinuation for recurrent or higher grade events. However, clinical experience suggests alternative strategies exist to safely maintain dosing.
METHODS: Case vignettes illustrating different EOPE clinical scenarios were assembled including 1) Successful treatment through initial EOPE; 2) Successful rechallenge after EOPE; 3) Successful rechallenge after EOPE utilizing a shallower step-up regimen; 4) Unsuccessful rechallenge.
RESULTS: Rapid tolerization to EOPEs within 5-8 days may occur with continued dosing suggesting dose interruption could be avoided with close observation and temporary supportive care (including supplemental oxygen). If dose interruption occurs, restarting at 30mg, followed by 30mg increments every 3 days to full dose as tolerated ('shallow step up dosing') may maximize safety during rechallenge. As compromised baseline respiratory function may increase the rate of clinically apparent EOPEs, proactive use of shallow step-up dosing could be considered in select cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinically apparent EOPEs are a rare complication of brigatinib. They occur within days of starting drug with rapid tolerization possible during continued dosing. Adapting the EOPE nomenclature to include the word 'transient' (TEOPEs) may further clinician and patient understanding in distinguishing these events from the pneumonitis seen with other TKIs. Improved education, appropriate supportive care and dosing should allow more patients to maximally and safely benefit from brigatinib.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metronomic chemotherapy (MC) is defined as the frequent administration of chemotherapy at doses below the maximal tolerated dose and with no prolonged drug-free break. As off-patent chemotherapeutic drugs can be used and given the low toxicity profile of this approach, MC seems to be well adapted to low-income countries.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a vincristine/cyclophosphamide/methotrexate MC regimen given to children with refractory cancer of various tumor types.
METHODS: This prospective, pilot, single-center study evaluated the use of MC with a first cycle consisting of weekly vincristine (1.5 mg/m) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, daily cyclophosphamide (25 mg/m) on days 1 to 21, and twice weekly methotrexate (15 mg/m) on days 21 to 42, followed by a 1-week break. For the following cycles, vincristine was administered only at weeks 1 and 5 of the cycle. This treatment was proposed to children with refractory cancer following treatments with the standard protocols available in our institution and to patients who were not eligible for the protocol. Adverse events were determined through laboratory analyses and investigator observations.
RESULTS: From November 2008 to December 2009, 12 children (median age, 3.7 y; range, 2 to 7 y) were included. The most frequent diagnoses were Wilms tumors (6) and retinoblastoma (5). No objective response was observed, but 7 patients experienced disease stabilization (58\%) and continued their treatment for 15 to 24 weeks. After a median follow-up of 39 weeks, 6 patients (50\%) were alive. Most importantly, in 3 patients (25\%), disease remained stable for at least 6 months after completion of treatment. One grade 4 anemia was observed in 1 patient and 1 grade 4 nonfebrile neutropenia in 1 patient. No other grade 3 or 4 toxicities were noted.
CONCLUSION: The MC regimen that we report here was well tolerated and was associated with disease stabilization. Most importantly, stabilization could be maintained for over 6 additional months after completion of treatment in 3 patients. The potential of MC in children and young adults in low-income countries warrants further studies.},

Tumor centrality was defined per the RTOG 0813 protocol. We defined "ultra-central" tumors as those with GTV directly abutting the central airway.
RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 18.4 months and median overall survival was 38.1 months. Two-year overall survival was similar between ultra-central, central, and peripheral NSCLC (80.0\% vs. 63.2\% vs. 86.6\%, P=0.62), as was 2-year local failure (0\% vs. 10.0\% vs. 16.3\%, P=0.64). Toxicity rates were low and comparable between the three groups, with only two cases of grade 3 toxicity (chest wall pain), and one case of grade 4 toxicity (pneumonitis) observed. Patients with ultra-central tumors experienced no symptomatic toxicities over a median follow-up time of 23.6 months. Dosimetric analysis revealed that RTOG 0813 central airway dose constraints were frequently not achieved in central tumor treatment plans, but this did not correlate with increased toxicity rate.
CONCLUSION: Patients with central and ultra-central lung tumors treated with SABR (50 Gy in 4-5 fractions) experienced few toxicities and good outcomes, similar to patients with peripheral lung tumors.},

	abstract = {Complex biological systems often display a randomness paralleled in processes studied in fundamental physics. This simple stochasticity emerges owing to the complexity of the system and underlies a fundamental aspect of biology called phenotypic stochasticity. Ongoing stochastic fluctuations in phenotype at the single-unit level can contribute to two emergent population phenotypes. Phenotypic stochasticity not only generates heterogeneity within a cell population, but also allows reversible transitions back and forth between multiple states. This phenotypic interconversion tends to restore a population to a previous composition after that population has been depleted of specific members. We call this tendency homeostatic heterogeneity. These concepts of dynamic heterogeneity can be applied to populations composed of molecules, cells, individuals, etc. Here we discuss the concept that phenotypic stochasticity both underlies the generation of heterogeneity within a cell population and can be used to control population composition, contributing, in particular, to both the ongoing emergence of drug resistance and an opportunity for depleting drug-resistant cells. Using notions of both 'large' and 'small' numbers of biomolecular components, we rationalize our use of Markov processes to model the generation and eradication of drug-resistant cells. Using these insights, we have developed a graphical tool, called a metronomogram, that we propose will allow us to optimize dosing frequencies and total course durations for clinical benefit.},

	doi = {10.1200/JCO.2007.11.6699},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Phase II trials suggested that weekly paclitaxel might be more effective and less toxic than every-3-weeks administration for metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocol 9840 was initiated to address this question. Subsequently trastuzumab was demonstrated to improve outcomes of paclitaxel therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)-positive patients, and was therefore incorporated. Because inhibition of HER-family signaling had potential efficacy even without HER-2 overexpression, we randomly assigned for trastuzumab in this population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or 80 mg/m(2) weekly. After the first 171 patients, all HER-2-positive patients received trastuzumab; HER-2 nonoverexpressors were randomly assigned for trastuzumab, in addition to paclitaxel schedule. A total of 577 patients were treated on 9840. An additional 158 patients were included in analyses, for combined sample of 735. The primary end point was response rate (RR); secondary end points were time to progression (TTP), overall survival, and toxicity. Primary comparisons were between weekly versus every-3-weeks paclitaxel, and trastuzumab versus no trastuzumab in HER-2 nonoverexpressors.
RESULTS: In the combined sample, weekly paclitaxel was superior to every-3-weeks administration: RR (42\% v 29\%, unadjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.75; P = .0004), TTP (median, 9 v 5 months; adjusted HR = 1.43; P {\textless} .0001), and survival (median, 24 v 12 months; adjusted HR = 1.28; P = .0092). For HER-2 nonoverexpressors, trastuzumab did not improve efficacy. Grade 3 neuropathy was more common with weekly dosing (24\% v 12\%; P = .0003).
CONCLUSION: Weekly paclitaxel is more effective than every-3-weeks administration for MBC. Trastuzumab did not improve efficacy for HER-2 nonoverexpressors. Neurotoxicity is a treatment-limiting toxicity for weekly paclitaxel.},

Based on the Loewe additivity reference model, many existing response surface models require constant relative potency and some of them use a single parameter to capture synergy, additivity, or antagonism. However, the assumption of constant relative potency is too restrictive, and these models using a single parameter to capture drug interaction are inadequate to describe the phenomenon when synergy, additivity, and antagonism are interspersed in different regions of drug combinations. We propose a generalized response surface model with a function of doses instead of one single parameter to identify and quantify departure from additivity. The proposed model can incorporate varying relative potencies among multiple drugs as well. Examples and simulations are given to demonstrate that the proposed model is effective in capturing different patterns of drug interaction.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: he response to acute and long-term arginine starvation results in a conditional adaptive metabolic reprogramming that can be harnessed for therapeutic opportunities in ASS1-negative tumors. Here, we investigate the underlying biology of priming ASS1(-) tumors with arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) before treatment with gemcitabine (GEM) and docetaxel (DTX) in sarcoma, pancreatic cancer and melanoma cell lines.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ASS1(-) tumor cell lines were treated to create LTAT (long term ADI treated) cell lines (ASS1+) and used for drug combination studies. Protein expression of ASS1, dCK, RRM2, E2F1, c-MYC and hENT1 were measured. c-MYC activity was determined, live-cell immunofluorescent studies for hENT1, uptake assays of FITC-cytosine probe and rescue studies with a c-MYC inhibitor were all determined in the presence or absence of the ADI-PEG20:GEM:DTX.
RESULTS: In examining modulations within the pyrimidine pathway, we identified that the addition of docetaxel (DTX) to cells treated ADI-PEG20 resulted in translocation of stabilized c-Myc to the nucleus. This resulted in an increase of hENT1 cell surface expression and rendered the cells susceptible to GEM. In vivo studies demonstrate that the combination of ADI-PEG20:GEM:DTX was optimal for tumor growth inhibition, providing the preclinical mechanism and justification for the ongoing clinical trial of ADI-PEG20, GEM, and DTX in sarcoma.
CONCLUSIONS: The priming of tumors with ADI-PEG20 and docetaxel results in the stabilization of c-MYC potentiating the effect of GEM treatment via an increase in hENT1 expression. This finding is applicable to ASS1-deficient cancers that are currently treated with GEM.},

With standard response surface modelling methods, finding the optimum combination with as few as 10 variables entails testing over 1,000 combinations, so these methods do not provide a feasible approach to such problems. However, they may be tackled by direct search methods (DSM), i.e. stepwise searches of the response surface. Experiments were carried out in advanced L1210 leukaemia treated with combinations of adriamycin with cyclophosphamide, isophosphamide with acetylcysteine and methotrexate with leucovorin. Two established DSM (Nelder-Mead and Box) were used, and a new method was designed to find consistent search paths in spite of wide biological variation. With methotrexate and leucovorin, DSM located combinations prolonging mean survival to 40-50 days (compared with 10.4 in controls) and giving high proportions of long-term survivors. These results were achieved with single injections of drugs given 7 days after injection of 10(6) leukaemic cells, i.e. 2-3 days before deaths began in untreated mice, and appear to be unprecedented with these agents. Searching for optimal combinations of established agents may be at least as rewarding as searching for new agents, and thus DSM may prove a powerful tool for improving the results of combination cancer chemotherapy.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Human epidermal growth factor 2 (Her2), a receptor tyrosine kinase, is overexpressed in breast cancers. It has been successfully targeted by small molecule kinase inhibitors and by antibodies. Recent clinical data show a synergistic response in patients when two antibodies, trastuzumab and pertuzumab, are given in combination.
METHODS: This unexpected effect is rationalized through computer models and molecular dynamic simulations by hypothesizing that the two antibodies can co-localize on the same molecule of the Her2 extracellular domain.
RESULTS: Simulations suggest that the clinical synergism observed for the two antibodies arises partly from enhanced affinity that originates in cooperative interactions between these two antibodies when they are co-localized on Her2 and "clamp" it; this may inhibit dimerization and possibly higher oligomerizations with neighboring receptors. In the presence of trastuzumab, the receptor becomes highly plastic, especially domains I to III, and this appears to promote increased association with pertuzumab. Further, the presence of pertuzumab evokes novel interactions between the receptor and trastuzumab. Indeed, splicing out of this region in silico results in a big reduction in the interactions of the antibody with the receptor.
CONCLUSIONS: If validated, these findings will bring about a new direction in the design of antibodies whereby different epitopes on the same antibody may be targeted to lead to synergistic/cooperative inhibition and contribute to generate more potent therapeutics and to increase clinical efficacy.},

Despite this achievement, most patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer still show progression of their disease, highlighting the need for new therapies. The continuous interest in novel targeted agents led to the development of pertuzumab, the first in a new class of agents, the HER dimerization inhibitors. Pertuzumab is a novel recombinant humanized antibody directed against extracellular domain II of HER2 protein that is required for the heterodimerization of HER2 with other HER receptors, leading to the activation of downstream signalling pathways. Pertuzumab combined with trastuzumab plus docetaxel was approved for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and is currently used as a standard of care in this indication. In the neoadjuvant setting, the drug was granted FDA-accelerated approval in 2013. Pertuzumab is also being evaluated in the adjuvant setting. The potential of pertuzumab relies in the dual complete blockade of the HER2/3 axis when administered with trastuzumab. This paper synthetises preclinical and clinical data on pertuzumab and highlights the mechanisms underlying the synergistic activity of the combination pertuzumab-trastuzumab which are essentially due to their complementary mode of action.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma has been revolutionised by targeted therapy with drugs that block angiogenesis. So far, no phase 3 randomised trials comparing the effectiveness of one targeted agent against another have been reported. We did a randomised phase 3 study comparing axitinib, a potent and selective second-generation inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, with sorafenib, an approved VEGF receptor inhibitor, as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer.
METHODS: We included patients coming from 175 sites (hospitals and outpatient clinics) in 22 countries aged 18 years or older with confirmed renal clear-cell carcinoma who progressed despite first-line therapy containing sunitinib, bevacizumab plus interferon-alfa, temsirolimus, or cytokines. Patients were stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and type of previous treatment and then randomly assigned (1:1) to either axitinib (5 mg twice daily) or sorafenib (400 mg twice daily). Axitinib dose increases to 7 mg and then to 10 mg, twice daily, were allowed for those patients without hypertension or adverse reactions above grade 2. Participants were not masked to study treatment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and was assessed by a masked, independent radiology review and analysed by intention to treat. This trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00678392.
FINDINGS: A total of 723 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive axitinib (n=361) or sorafenib (n=362). The median PFS was 6·7 months with axitinib compared to 4·7 months with sorafenib (hazard ratio 0·665; 95\% CI 0·544-0·812; one-sided p{\textless}0·0001). Treatment was discontinued because of toxic effects in 14 (4\%) of 359 patients treated with axitinib and 29 (8\%) of 355 patients treated with sorafenib. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea, hypertension, and fatigue in the axitinib arm, and diarrhoea, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia, and alopecia in the sorafenib arm.
INTERPRETATION: Axitinib resulted in significantly longer PFS compared with sorafenib. Axitinib is a treatment option for second-line therapy of advanced renal cell carcinoma.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Axitinib (AG-013736) is an oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3. We aimed to assess the activity and safety of axitinib in patients with metastatic renal-cell cancer who had failed on previous cytokine-based treatment.
METHODS: Between Oct 3, 2003, and April 7, 2004, 52 patients were enrolled. All patients who had at least one measurable target lesion received axitinib orally (starting dose 5 mg twice daily). The primary endpoint was objective response (ie, percentage of patients with confirmed complete response or partial response by use of Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria. Secondary endpoints were duration of response, time to progression, overall survival, safety, pharmacokinetics, and patient-reported health-related quality of life. This trial is registered on the clinical trials site of the US National Cancer Institute website http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00076011.
FINDINGS: In an intention-to-treat analysis, two complete and 21 partial responses were noted, for an objective response rate of 44.2\% (95\% CI 30.5-58.7). Median response duration was 23.0 months (20.9-not estimable; range 4.2-29.8). However, 12 of 23 initial responders progressed with response duration ranging from 4.2 months to 26.5 months. Additionally, 22 patients showed stable disease for longer than 8 weeks, including 13 patients with stable disease for 24 weeks or longer. Four patients had early disease progression. Three patients had missing response data. Median time to progression was 15.7 months (8.4-23.4, range 0.03-31.5) and median overall survival was 29.9 months (20.3-not estimable; range 2.4-35.8). Treatment-related adverse events included diarrhoea, hypertension, fatigue, nausea, and hoarseness. Treatment-related hypertension occurred in 30 patients and resolved with antihypertensive treatment in all but eight patients, of whom seven patients had a history of hypertension at baseline.
INTERPRETATION: Axitinib shows clinical activity in patients with cytokine-refractory metastatic renal-cell cancer. Although 28 patients had grade 3 or grade 4 treatment-related adverse events, these adverse events were generally manageable and controlled by dose modification or supportive care, or both. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.},

	abstract = {Leukemia cells isolated from eight patients with acute leukemia before treatment were examined for in vitro uptake of daunorubicin (DNR) and inhibition of DNA synthesis. In addition, plasma and cellular levels of DNR and daunorubicinol (DOL) were examined in six of the eight patients. Inhibition of DNA synthesis was determined with a 3H-thymidine incorporation assay. In vitro cellular 14C-DNR was quantified by means of liquid scintillation spectrometry, whereas in vivo DNR and DOL concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. In vitro intracellular plateau concentrations of DNR were achieved within 1-2 h after continuous exposure to 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 microgram/ml in the majority of cases. Based on our in vitro studies, a dose-response curve was found between increasing intracellular DNR and incorporation of 3H-thymidine. Peak intracellular levels of DNR after treatment occurred immediately after administration of the drug, whereas intracellular DOL levels accumulated over several hours. Plasma concentrations of DNR and DOL were not useful in estimating target tissue concentrations or inhibition of 3H-thymidine incorporation. Extrapolation of in vivo cellular DNR concentrations to the in vitro dose-response curve allows an estimate of DNR sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Medical therapy often consists of multiple stages, with a treatment chosen by the physician at each stage based on the patient's history of treatments and clinical outcomes. These decisions can be formalized as a dynamic treatment regime. This paper describes a new approach for optimizing dynamic treatment regimes that bridges the gap between Bayesian inference and existing approaches, like Q-learning. The proposed approach fits a series of Bayesian regression models, one for each stage, in reverse sequential order. Each model uses as a response variable the remaining payoff assuming optimal actions are taken at subsequent stages, and as covariates the current history and relevant actions at that stage. The key difficulty is that the optimal decision rules at subsequent stages are unknown, and even if these decision rules were known the relevant response variables may be counterfactual. However, posterior distributions can be derived from the previously fitted regression models for the optimal decision rules and the counterfactual response variables under a particular set of rules. The proposed approach averages over these posterior distributions when fitting each regression model. An efficient sampling algorithm for estimation is presented, along with simulation studies that compare the proposed approach with Q-learning.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and is associated with poor survival. The Ivy Foundation Early Phase Clinical Trials Consortium conducted a randomized, multi-institution clinical trial to evaluate immune responses and survival following neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab in 35 patients with recurrent, surgically resectable glioblastoma. Patients who were randomized to receive neoadjuvant pembrolizumab, with continued adjuvant therapy following surgery, had significantly extended overall survival compared to patients that were randomized to receive adjuvant, post-surgical programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade alone. Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade was associated with upregulation of T cell– and interferon-γ-related gene expression, but downregulation of cell-cycle-related gene expression within the tumor, which was not seen in patients that received adjuvant therapy alone. Focal induction of programmed death-ligand 1 in the tumor microenvironment, enhanced clonal expansion of T cells, decreased PD-1 expression on peripheral blood T cells and a decreasing monocytic population was observed more frequently in the neoadjuvant group than in patients treated only in the adjuvant setting. These findings suggest that the neoadjuvant administration of PD-1 blockade enhances both the local and systemic antitumor immune response and may represent a more efficacious approach to the treatment of this uniformly lethal brain tumor.},

	abstract = {Owing to improvements in our understanding of the biological principles of tumour initiation and progression, a wide variety of novel targeted therapies have been developed. Developments in biomedical imaging, however, have not kept pace with these improvements and are still mainly designed to determine lesion size alone, which is reflected in the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Imaging approaches currently used for the evaluation of treatment responses in patients with solid tumours, therefore, often fail to detect successful responses to novel targeted agents and might even falsely suggest disease progression, a scenario known as pseudoprogression. The ability to differentiate between responders and nonresponders early in the course of treatment is essential to allowing the early adjustment of treatment regimens. Various imaging approaches targeting a single dedicated tumour feature, as described in the hallmarks of cancer, have been successful in preclinical investigations, and some have been evaluated in pilot clinical trials. However, these approaches have largely not been implemented in clinical practice. In this Review, we describe current biomedical imaging approaches used to monitor responses to treatment in patients receiving novel targeted therapies, including a summary of the most promising future approaches and how these might improve clinical practice.},

We demonstrate both the reproducibility and the clinical translatability of this approach by identifying associations between a genotype and drug response, and established mechanisms of resistance. In addition, our results suggest that PCTs may represent a more accurate approach than cell line models for assessing the clinical potential of some therapeutic modalities.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with metastatic breast cancer that is positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), progression-free survival was significantly improved after first-line therapy with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel, as compared with placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel. Overall survival was significantly improved with pertuzumab in an interim analysis without the median being reached. We report final prespecified overall survival results with a median follow-up of 50 months.
METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with metastatic breast cancer who had not received previous chemotherapy or anti-HER2 therapy for their metastatic disease to receive the pertuzumab combination or the placebo combination. The secondary end points of overall survival, investigator-assessed progression-free survival, independently assessed duration of response, and safety are reported. Sensitivity analyses were adjusted for patients who crossed over from placebo to pertuzumab after the interim analysis.
RESULTS: The median overall survival was 56.5 months (95\% confidence interval [CI], 49.3 to not reached) in the group receiving the pertuzumab combination, as compared with 40.8 months (95\% CI, 35.8 to 48.3) in the group receiving the placebo combination (hazard ratio favoring the pertuzumab group, 0.68; 95\% CI, 0.56 to 0.84; P{\textless}0.001), a difference of 15.7 months. This analysis was not adjusted for crossover to the pertuzumab group and is therefore conservative. Results of sensitivity analyses after adjustment for crossover were consistent. Median progression-free survival as assessed by investigators improved by 6.3 months in the pertuzumab group (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95\% CI, 0.58 to 0.80). Pertuzumab extended the median duration of response by 7.7 months, as independently assessed. Most adverse events occurred during the administration of docetaxel in the two groups, with long-term cardiac safety maintained.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab and docetaxel, as compared with the addition of placebo, significantly improved the median overall survival to 56.5 months and extended the results of previous analyses showing the efficacy of this drug combination.

However, depending on the postulated null hypothesis of non-interaction, one may end up in different interpretations of synergy. Two popular reference models for null hypothesis include the Bliss independence model and the Loewe additivity model, each of which is formulated from different perspectives. During the last century, there has been an intensive debate on the suitability of these synergy models, both of which are theoretically justified and also in practice supported by different schools of scientists. More than 20 years ago, there was a community effort to make a consensus on the terminology one should use when claiming synergy. The agreement was formulated at a conference held in Saariselkä, Finland in 1992, stating that one should use the terms Bliss synergy or Loewe synergy to avoid ambiguity in the underlying models. We review the theoretical relationships between these models and argue that one should combine the advantages of both models to provide a more consistent definition of synergy and antagonism.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Neuroblastoma is treated with aggressive multimodal therapy, yet more than 50\% of patients experience relapse. We recently showed that relapsed neuroblastomas frequently harbor mutations leading to hyperactivated ERK signaling and sensitivity to MEK inhibition therapy. Here we sought to define a synergistic therapeutic partner to potentiate MEK inhibition.Experimental Design: We first surveyed 22 genetically annotated human neuroblastoma-derived cell lines (from 20 unique patients) for sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor binimetinib. After noting an inverse correlation with sensitivity to ribociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor), we studied the combinatorial effect of these two agents using proliferation assays, cell-cycle analysis, Ki67 immunostaining, time-lapse microscopy, and xenograft studies.Results: Sensitivity to binimetinib and ribociclib was inversely related (r = -0.58, P = 0.009). MYCN amplification status and expression were associated with ribociclib sensitivity and binimetinib resistance, whereas increased MAPK signaling was the main determinant of binimetinib sensitivity and ribociclib resistance. Treatment with both compounds resulted in synergistic or additive cellular growth inhibition in all lines tested and significant inhibition of tumor growth in three of four xenograft models of neuroblastoma. The augmented growth inhibition was attributed to diminished cell-cycle progression that was reversible upon removal of drugs.Conclusions: Here we demonstrate that combined binimetinib and ribociclib treatment shows therapeutic synergy across a broad panel of high-risk neuroblastoma preclinical models. These data support testing this combination therapy in relapsed high-risk neuroblastoma patients, with focus on cases with hyperactivated RAS-MAPK signaling.

	abstract = {This work considers Phase I cancer dual-agent dose-escalation clinical trials in which one of the compounds is an immunotherapy. The distinguishing feature of trials considered is that the dose of one agent, referred to as a standard of care, is fixed and another agent is dose-escalated. Conventionally, the goal of a Phase I trial is to find the maximum tolerated combination (MTC). However, in trials involving an immunotherapy, it is also essential to test whether a difference in toxicities associated with the MTC and the standard of care alone is present. This information can give useful insights about the interaction of the compounds and can provide a quantification of the additional toxicity burden and therapeutic index. We show that both, testing for difference between toxicity risks and selecting MTC can be achieved using a Bayesian model-based dose-escalation design with two modifications. Firstly, the standard of care administrated alone is included in the trial as a control arm and each patient is randomized between the control arm and one of the combinations selected by a model-based design. Secondly, a flexible model is used to allow for toxicities at the MTC and the control arm to be modeled directly. We compare the performance of two-parameter and four-parameter logistic models with and without randomization to a current standard of such trials: a one-parameter model. It is found that at the cost of a small reduction in the proportion of correct selections in some scenarios, randomization provides a significant improvement in the ability to test for a difference in the toxicity risks. It also allows a better fitting of the combination-toxicity curve that leads to more reliable recommendations of the combination(s) to be studied in subsequent phases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing the dose intensity of cytotoxic therapy by shortening the intervals between cycles, or by giving individual drugs sequentially at full dose rather than in lower-dose concurrent treatment schedules, might enhance efficacy.
METHODS: To clarify the relative benefits and risks of dose-intense and standard-schedule chemotherapy in early breast cancer, we did an individual patient-level meta-analysis of trials comparing 2-weekly versus standard 3-weekly schedules, and of trials comparing sequential versus concurrent administration of anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy. The primary outcomes were recurrence and breast cancer mortality. Standard intention-to-treat log-rank analyses, stratified by age, nodal status, and trial, yielded dose-intense versus standard-schedule first-event rate ratios (RRs).
FINDINGS: Individual patient data were provided for 26 of 33 relevant trials identified, comprising 37 298 (93\%) of 40 070 women randomised. Most women were aged younger than 70 years and had node-positive disease. Total cytotoxic drug usage was broadly comparable in the two treatment arms; colony-stimulating factor was generally used in the more dose-intense arm. Combining data from all 26 trials, fewer breast cancer recurrences were seen with dose-intense than with standard-schedule chemotherapy (10-year recurrence risk 28·0\% vs 31·4\%; RR 0·86, 95\% CI 0·82-0·89; p{\textless}0·0001). 10-year breast cancer mortality was similarly reduced (18·9\% vs 21·3\%; RR 0·87, 95\% CI 0·83-0·92; p{\textless}0·0001), as was all-cause mortality (22·1\% vs 24·8\%; RR 0·87, 95\% CI 0·83-0·91; p{\textless}0·0001). Death without recurrence was, if anything, lower with dose-intense than with standard-schedule chemotherapy (10-year risk 4·1\% vs 4·6\%; RR 0·88, 95\% CI 0·78-0·99; p=0·034). Recurrence reductions were similar in the seven trials (n=10 004) that compared 2-weekly chemotherapy with the same chemotherapy given 3-weekly (10-year risk 24·0\% vs 28·3\%; RR 0·83, 95\% CI 0·76-0·91; p{\textless}0·0001), in the six trials (n=11 028) of sequential versus concurrent anthracycline plus taxane chemotherapy (28·1\% vs 31·3\%; RR 0·87, 95\% CI 0·80-0·94; p=0·0006), and in the six trials (n=6532) testing both shorter intervals and sequential administration (30·4\% vs 35·0\%; RR 0·82, 95\% CI 0·74-0·90; p{\textless}0·0001). The proportional reductions in recurrence with dose-intense chemotherapy were similar and highly significant (p{\textless}0·0001) in oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative disease and did not differ significantly by other patient or tumour characteristics.
INTERPRETATION: Increasing the dose intensity of adjuvant chemotherapy by shortening the interval between treatment cycles, or by giving individual drugs sequentially rather than giving the same drugs concurrently, moderately reduces the 10-year risk of recurrence and death from breast cancer without increasing mortality from other causes.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Hyperprogression (HP), a paradoxical boost in tumor growth, was described in a subset of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Neither clinicopathologic features nor biological mechanisms associated with HP have been identified.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Among 187 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with ICI at our institute, cases with HP were identified according to clinical and radiologic criteria. Baseline histologic samples from patients treated with ICI were evaluated by IHC for myeloid and lymphoid markers. T-cell-deficient mice, injected with human lung cancer cells and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) belonging to specific mutational subsets, were assessed for tumor growth after treatment with antibodies against mouse and human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). The immune microenvironment was evaluated by flow cytometry and IHC.
RESULTS: Among 187 patients, 152 were evaluable for clinical response. We identified four categories: 32 cases were defined as responders (21\%), 42 patients with stable disease (27.7\%), 39 cases were defined as progressors (25.7\%), and 39 patients with HP (25.7\%). Pretreatment tissue samples from all patients with HP showed tumor infiltration by M2-like CD163+CD33+PD-L1+ clustered epithelioid macrophages. Enrichment by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) was observed, even in tumor nodules from immunodeficient mice injected with human lung cancer cells and with PDXs. In these models, tumor growth was enhanced by treatment with anti-PD-1 but not anti-PD-1 F(ab)2 fragments.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a crucial role of TAM reprogramming, upon Fc receptor engagement by ICI, eventually inducing HP and provide clues on a distinctive immunophenotype potentially able to predict HP.See related commentary by Knorr and Ravetch, p. 904.},

	abstract = {Combining radiotherapy with immune checkpoint blockade may offer considerable therapeutic impact if the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) can be relieved. In this study, we used mathematical models, which can illustrate the potential synergism between immune checkpoint inhibitors and radiotherapy. A discrete-time pharmacodynamic model of the combination of radiotherapy with inhibitors of the PD1-PDL1 axis and/or the CTLA4 pathway is described. This mathematical framework describes how a growing tumor first elicits and then inhibits an antitumor immune response. This antitumor immune response is described by a primary and a secondary (or memory) response. The primary immune response appears first and is inhibited by the PD1-PDL1 axis, whereas the secondary immune response happens next and is inhibited by the CTLA4 pathway. The effects of irradiation are described by a modified version of the linear-quadratic model. This modeling offers an explanation for the reported biphasic relationship between the size of a tumor and its immunogenicity, as measured by the abscopal effect (an off-target immune response). Furthermore, it explains why discontinuing immunotherapy may result in either tumor recurrence or a durably sustained response. Finally, it describes how synchronizing immunotherapy and radiotherapy can produce synergies. The ability of the model to forecast pharmacodynamic endpoints was validated retrospectively by checking that it could describe data from experimental studies, which investigated the combination of radiotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In summary, a model such as this could be further used as a simulation tool to facilitate decision making about optimal scheduling of immunotherapy with radiotherapy and perhaps other types of anticancer therapies.

Methods In this phase II, open-label trial, patients with predefined BRAF V600E-mutated malignancies received dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or death. The primary end point was investigator-assessed overall response rate. Secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Results Sixteen patients with BRAF V600E-mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer were evaluable (median follow-up, 47 weeks; range, 4 to 120 weeks). All patients had received prior radiation treatment and/or surgery, and six had received prior systemic therapy. The confirmed overall response rate was 69\% (11 of 16; 95\% CI, 41\% to 89\%), with seven ongoing responses. Median duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were not reached as a result of a lack of events, with 12-month estimates of 90\%, 79\%, and 80\%, respectively. The safety population was composed of 100 patients who were enrolled with seven rare tumor histologies. Common adverse events were fatigue (38\%), pyrexia (37\%), and nausea (35\%). No new safety signals were detected. Conclusion Dabrafenib plus trametinib is the first regimen demonstrated to have robust clinical activity in BRAF V600E-mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer and was well tolerated. These findings represent a meaningful therapeutic advance for this orphan disease.},

	abstract = {γ9δ2T cells play a critical role in daily cancer immune surveillance by sensing cancer-mediated metabolic changes. However, a major limitation of the therapeutic application of γ9δ2T cells is their diversity and regulation through innate co-receptors. In order to overcome natural obstacles of γ9δ2T cells, we have developed the concept of T cells engineered to express a defined γδT cell receptor (TEGs). This next generation of chimeric antigen receptor engineered T (CAR-T) cells not only allows for targeting of hematological but also of solid tumors and, therefore, overcomes major limitations of many CAR-T and γδT cell strategies. Here, we report on the development of a robust manufacturing procedure of T cells engineered to express the high affinity Vγ9Vδ2T cell receptor (TCR) clone 5 (TEG001). We determined the best concentration of anti-CD3/CD28 activation and expansion beads, optimal virus titer, and cell density for retroviral transduction, and validated a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-grade purification procedure by utilizing the CliniMACS system to deplete non- and poorly-engineered T cells. To the best of our knowledge, we have developed the very first GMP manufacturing procedure in which αβTCR depletion is used as a purification method, thereby delivering untouched clinical grade engineered immune cells. This enrichment method is applicable to any engineered T cell product with a reduced expression of endogenous αβTCRs. We report on release criteria and the stability of TEG001 drug substance and TEG001 drug product. The GMP-grade production procedure is now approved by Dutch authorities and allows TEG001 to be generated in cell numbers sufficient to treat patients within the approved clinical trial NTR6541. NTR6541 will investigate the safety and tolerability of TEG001 in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia, high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This study examined safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of veliparib, a PARP inhibitor, combined with carboplatin and etoposide in patients with extensive-stage (ED) small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and other solid tumors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 3 + 3 design was used for dose escalation of oral veliparib in combination with carboplatin (AUC 5 on day 1) and etoposide (100 mg/m2 on days 1-3) in 21-day cycles. Veliparib dose was explored from 80 to 240 mg b.i.d. on 7-day, 14-day, or continuous schedules. Patients without disease progression continued on maintenance monotherapy (veliparib 400 mg b.i.d.) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were enrolled to determine the recommended phase II dose of 240 mg veliparib for 14 days combined with carboplatin and etoposide based on long-term tolerability. Dose-limiting toxicity occurred in 1 patient (grade 2 toxic motor polyneuropathy) at veliparib 240 mg b.i.d. for 7 days. Most common adverse events related to veliparib were nausea (39\%), fatigue (39\%), and hematologic toxicities. Continuous dosing of veliparib 240 mg b.i.d. with carboplatin and etoposide resulted in excessive chemotherapy dose delays due to hematologic toxicity (grade 3/4 neutropenia/thrombocytopenia). Etoposide pharmacokinetics was not affected by veliparib. Confirmed responses occurred in 17 of 39 (44\%) and 16 of 25 (64\%) of all enrolled and ED SCLC patients, respectively. At the RP2D, confirmed responses occurred in 6 of 13 (46\%) and 5 of 6 (83\%) of all enrolled and ED SCLC patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Veliparib (240 mg b.i.d. 14 days) plus carboplatin/etoposide can be safely combined. Phase II of this study is ongoing in first-line patients with ED SCLC.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Glioblastomas are among the most lethal neoplasms, with a median survival of {\textless}1 year. Modulation of the proteasome function has emerged as a novel approach to cancer pharmacotherapy. Here, we characterized the antitumor properties of SC68896, a novel small molecule proteasome inhibitor.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Different tumor cell lines were tested by crystal violet staining for sensitivity to SC68896, given alone or in combination with death ligands. The molecular mechanisms mediating SC68896-induced cell death and changes in cell cycle progression were assessed by immunoblot and flow cytometry. An orthotopic human glioma xenograft model in nude mice was used to examine the in vivo activity of SC68896.
RESULTS: SC68896 inhibits the proliferation of cell lines of different types of cancer, including malignant glioma. Exposure of LNT-229 glioma cells to SC68896 results in a concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of the proteasome, with a consequent accumulation of p21 and p27 proteins, cell cycle arrest, caspase cleavage, and induction of apoptosis. Using RNA interference, we show that the effect of SC68896 on glioma cells is facilitated by wild-type p53. SC68896 sensitizes glioma cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and CD95 ligand and up-regulates the cell surface expression of the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor cell death receptors 4 and 5, which may contribute to this sensitization. Intracerebral glioma-bearing nude mice treated either i.p. or intratumorally with SC68896 experience prolonged survival.
CONCLUSIONS: SC68896 is the first proteasome inhibitor that exerts antiglioma activity in vivo. It may represent a novel prototype agent for the treatment of malignant gliomas and warrants clinical evaluation.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Marizomib (NPI-0052) is an irreversible proteasome inhibitor, derived from a marine actinomycete, with activity and specificity that is distinct from other proteasome inhibitors.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Phase I study (NPI-0052-102) evaluated the MTD, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of marizomib intravenously on two dosing schedules.
RESULTS: Forty-two patients with advanced malignancies received Schedule A (0.1-0.9 mg/m(2) over 1-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15 in 4-week cycles); 44 patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) and other hematologic malignancies received Schedule B (0.075-0.6 mg/m(2) over 1 minute to 2 hours on days 1, 4, 8, 11, in 3-week cycles). The Schedule A recommended phase II dose was 0.7 mg/m(2) over 10 minutes; Schedule B was 0.5 mg/m(2) over 2 hours. The most common ({\textgreater}25\% of patients) related adverse events were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and infusion site pain (Schedule A); and fatigue (Schedule B). Overall response rate of 11\% was seen in 27 efficacy-evaluable RRMM Schedule B patients (1 very good partial response, 3 partial responses, 4 minimal responses, and 12 stable disease). One Schedule A patient with transformed marginal zone lymphoma had complete response. Marizomib has a short half-life ({\textless}30 minutes), with high volume of distribution (∼15-416 L) and clearance (∼0.9-22 L/minutes).
CONCLUSIONS: Marizomib does not exhibit the severe peripheral neuropathy or hematologic toxicity observed with other proteasome inhibitors. Marizomib was generally well tolerated with low-dose dexamethasone, demonstrated activity in heavily pretreated RRMM patients, and warrants further evaluation.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Combining proteasome and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition has been seen to provide synergistic anti-tumor activity, with complementary effects on a number of signaling pathways. The novel bi-cyclic structure of marizomib with its unique proteasome inhibition, toxicology and efficacy profiles, suggested utility in combining it with an HDAC inhibitor such as vorinostat. Thus, in this study in vitro studies assessed the potential utility of combining marizomib and vorinostat, followed by a clinical trial with the objectives of assessing the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of the combination in patients.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Combinations of marizomib and vorinostat were assessed in vitro. Subsequently, in a Phase 1 clinical trial patients with melanoma, pancreatic carcinoma or Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) were given escalating doses of weekly marizomib in combination with vorinostat 300 mg daily for 16 days in 28 day cycles. In addition to standard safety studies, proteasome inhibition and pharmacokinetics were assayed.
RESULTS: Marked synergy of marizomib and vorinostat was seen in tumor cell lines derived from patients with NSCLC, melanoma and pancreatic carcinoma. In the clinical trial, 22 patients were enrolled. Increased toxicity was not seen with the combination. Co-administration did not appear to affect the PK or PD of either drug in comparison to historical data. Although no responses were demonstrated using RECIST criteria, 61\% of evaluable patients demonstrated stable disease with 39\% having decreases in tumor measurements.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of multiple tumor cell lines with marizomib and vorinostat resulted in a highly synergistic antitumor activity. The combination of full dose marizomib with vorinostat is tolerable in patients with safety findings consistent with either drug alone.},

	doi = {10.1212/WNL.0b013e318212a89f},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: New data suggest that glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) may share common origins. GSCs drive tumor proliferation and appear to be resistant to classic chemotherapy, while the effects of chemotherapy on NSCs are not well studied. As the role of NSCs in learning and memory is increasingly recognized, we need to identify drugs that reduce neurotoxicity but are still effective against glial tumors.
METHODS: We treated 3 human NSC cultures and multiple low- and high-grade GSC cultures with the commonly used agents temozolomide (TMZ) and cisplatin (CIS), and with 2 newer, promising drugs: the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ) and the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib (ERL). We measured cell survival, proliferation, cell death induction, and drug resistance markers.
RESULTS: TMZ decreased NSC viability, while minimally affecting GSCs. TMZ induced NSC death, which was partially compensated for by increased proliferation. CIS had similar effects. The NSC's sensitivity to TMZ and CIS correlated with low expression of the multidrug resistance gene ABCG2, but not of MGMT or MSH1/MLH2. BTZ caused an 80\%decrease in GSCs, while minimally affecting NSCs. GSCs had lower proteasome levels and activity after BTZ treatment. ERL treatment also decreased GSC numbers, but not NSC viability, which correlated with low EGFR expression in NSCs compared to GSCs.
CONCLUSIONS: Newer chemotherapy agents ERL and BTZ are effective against GSCs yet produce minimal effects on NSCs, while the older drugs TMZ and CIS are more toxic for NSCs than for GSCs. The identification and testing of more selective drugs is clearly warranted.},

	abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a functional and structural barrier separating the intravascular and neuropil compartments of the brain. It characterizes the vascular bed and is essential for normal brain functions. Dysfunction in the BBB properties have been described in most common neurological disorders, such as stroke, traumatic injuries, intracerebral hemorrhage, tumors, epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders. It is now obvious that the BBB plays an important role in normal brain activity, stressing the need for applicable imaging and assessment methods. Recent advancements in imaging techniques now make it possible to establish sensitive and quantitative methods for the assessment of BBB permeability. However, most of the existing techniques require complicated and demanding dynamic scanning protocols that are impractical and cannot be fulfilled in some cases. We review existing methods for the evaluation of BBB permeability, focusing on quantitative magnetic resonance-based approaches and discuss their drawbacks and limitations. In light of those limitations we propose two new approaches for BBB assessment with less demanding imaging sequences: the "post-pre" and the "linear dynamic" methods, both allow semi-quantitative permeability assessment and localization of dysfunctional BBB with simple/partial dynamic imaging protocols and easy-to-apply analysis algorithms. We present preliminary results and show an example which compares these new methods with the existing standard assessment method. We strongly believe that the establishment of such "easy to use" and reliable imaging methods is essential before BBB assessment can become a routine clinical tool. Large clinical trials are awaited to fully understand the significance of BBB permeability as a biomarker and target for treatment in neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {The proteasome has emerged as an important clinically relevant target for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Since the Food and Drug Administration approved the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) and mantle cell lymphoma, it has become clear that new inhibitors are needed that have a better therapeutic ratio, can overcome inherent and acquired bortezomib resistance and exhibit broader anti-cancer activities. Marizomib (NPI-0052; salinosporamide A) is a structurally and pharmacologically unique β-lactone-γ-lactam proteasome inhibitor that may fulfill these unmet needs. The potent and sustained inhibition of all three proteolytic activities of the proteasome by marizomib has inspired extensive preclinical evaluation in a variety of hematologic and solid tumor models, where it is efficacious as a single agent and in combination with biologics, chemotherapeutics and targeted therapeutic agents. Specifically, marizomib has been evaluated in models for multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, chronic and acute lymphocytic leukemia, as well as glioma, colorectal and pancreatic cancer models, and has exhibited synergistic activities in tumor models in combination with bortezomib, the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide (Revlimid), and various histone deacetylase inhibitors. These and other studies provided the framework for ongoing clinical trials in patients with MM, lymphomas, leukemias and solid tumors, including those who have failed bortezomib treatment, as well as in patients with diagnoses where other proteasome inhibitors have not demonstrated significant efficacy. This review captures the remarkable translational studies and contributions from many collaborators that have advanced marizomib from seabed to bench to bedside.},

METHODS: We searched published reports including these novel PIs containing regimens for R/RMM.
RESULTS: Finally, we identified 28 prospective studies that evaluated 4123 patients. Pooled analysis showed that novel PIs doublet combinations attained an impressive overall response rate (ORR) of 67\%, which was higher than that of 22\% from novel PIs single-agent (p {\textless} .001). And, the same trends favoring novel PIs doublet combinations were also shown in at least very good partial response (≥VGPR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) analysis. Meanwhile, the ORR of 70\% from novel PIs triplet regimens seemed to be similar to that of 67\% from novel PIs doublet combinations (p = .54). And, there were no difference between them in ≥VGPR and CBR analysis. Compared to standard therapy, novel PIs combinations clearly benefited patients with R/RMM in terms of overall survival (HR, 0.79; p= .01), progression free survival(HR, 0.64; p = .01), overall response rate (RR = 1.21 p {\textless} .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Novel PIs doublet combinations attained superior response outcomes over novel PIs single-agent in patients with R/RMM. Meanwhile, novel PIs triplet combinations had similar response outcomes with novel PIs doublet combinations. Compared to standard therapy, novel PIs combinations clearly prolonged survival for patients with R/RMM.},

	issn = {0306-5251},
	abstract = {AIMS: The main objective of this study was to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics of the novel proteasome inhibitor PS-519 in young male volunteers. Many pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and cell adhesion molecules that are responsible for the development of the cerebral infarct are under the control of the transcription factor Nuclear Factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB). The activity of NF-kappaB is itself tightly regulated through the multicatalytic enzyme known as the proteasome. PS-519 is a novel and highly selective small molecule that inhibits the proteasome. An ex vivo assay of 20S proteasome activity allows monitoring of the drug effect in blood. PS-519 is protective in multiple animal models of cerebral ischaemia over a range of doses that achieve 20S inhibition of 40\%-80\%.
METHODS: PS-519 has been administered to healthy male volunteers as single and repeated doses up to 1.6 mg m(-2). It was given as an intravenous bolus over 20-30 s in a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase I study, examining vital signs, safety, tolerability and blood 20S proteasome inhibition.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine subjects received single doses of 0.012 mg m-2-1.6 mg m(-2) and 28 subjects received doses of 0.5 mg m(-2)-1.6 mg m(-2) on three consecutive days. The drug was well tolerated. There was no clear treatment-emergent symptom or abnormality of laboratory tests. Proteasome inhibition in blood samples as measured by 20S assay achieved the intended maximum target level of 70-80\% with 1.6 mg m(-2), and was reproducible with repeated dosing.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated that proteasome inhibition is well tolerated by healthy subjects at levels that are maximally neuroprotective in experimental conditions. Further clinical evaluation appears justified.},

The results indicate that marizomib, which possesses a chemical-leaving group, is more cytotoxic to both cell lines and inhibits proteasome activity more completely at lower concentrations than NPI-0047, a nonleaving-group analog. Moreover, it was found that both compounds accumulate in these cells by simple diffusion and the same carrier-mediated transport system. Although the rate of uptake is similar, the cellular efflux, which does not seem to be mediated by a major ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-efflux transporter, is more rapid for NPI-0047 than for marizomib. Experiments revealed that the irreversible binding of marizomib to the proteasome is responsible for its slower efflux, longer duration of action, and greater cytotoxicity compared with NPI-0047. The discovery that major ABC transporters of the multidrug resistance-associated protein family do not seem to be involved in the accumulation or removal of these agents suggests they may not be affected by multidrug resistance mechanisms during prolonged administration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The proteasome plays a vital role in the physiology of glioblastoma (GBM), and proteasome inhibition can be used as a strategy for treating GBM. Marizomib is a second-generation, irreversible proteasome inhibitor with a more lipophilic structure that suggests the potential for penetrating the blood-brain barrier. While bortezomib and carfilzomib, the 2 proteasome inhibitors approved for treatment of multiple myeloma, have little activity against malignant gliomas in vivo, marizomib could be a novel therapeutic strategy for primary brain tumors.
METHODS: The in-vitro antitumor activity of marizomib was studied in glioma cell lines U-251 and D-54. The ability of marizomib to cross the blood-brain barrier and regulate proteasome activities was evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys and rats. The antitumor effect of marizomib in vivo was tested in an orthotopic xenograft model of human GBM.
RESULTS: Marizomib inhibited the proteasome activity, proliferation, and invasion of glioma cells. Meanwhile, free radical production and apoptosis induced by marizomib could be blocked by antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine. In animal studies, marizomib distributed into the brain at 30\% of blood levels in rats and significantly inhibited ({\textgreater}30\%) baseline chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity in brain tissue of monkeys. Encouragingly, the immunocompromised mice, intracranially implanted with glioma xenografts, survived significantly longer than the control animals (P {\textless} .05) when treated with marizomib.
CONCLUSIONS: These preclinical studies demonstrated that marizomib can cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibit proteasome activity in rodent and nonhuman primate brain and elicit a significant antitumor effect in a rodent intracranial model of malignant glioma.},

	abstract = {Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) are highly active in multiple myeloma (MM) but resistance is commonly observed. All clinical stage PIs effectively inhibit chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) activity; one possible mechanism of resistance is compensatory hyperactivation of caspase-like (C-L) and trypsin-like (T-L) subunits, in response to CT-L blockade. Marizomib (MRZ), an irreversible PI that potently inhibits all three 20S proteasome subunits with a specificity distinct from other PIs, is currently in development for treatment of MM and malignant glioma. The pan-proteasome pharmacodynamic activity in packed whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells was measured in two studies in patients with advanced solid tumours and haematological malignancies. Functional inhibition of all proteasome subunits was achieved with once- or twice-weekly MRZ dosing; 100\% inhibition of CT-L was frequently achieved within one cycle at therapeutic doses. Concomitantly, C-L and T-L activities were either unaffected or increased, suggesting compensatory hyperactivation of these subunits. Importantly, this response was overcome by continued administration of MRZ, with robust inhibition of T-L and C-L (up to 80\% and 50\%, respectively) by the end of Cycle 2 and maintained thereafter. This enhanced proteasome inhibition was independent of tumour type and may underlie the clinical activity of MRZ in patients resistant to other PIs.},

Study NPI-0052-101 Part 1 enrolled relapsed or RRMM patients into an open-label, dose-escalation design to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MRZ administered intravenously on 2 different schedules: schedule A (0.025-0.7 mg/m(2) once weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 of 4-week cycles) and schedule B (0.15-0.6 mg/m(2) twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of 3-week cycles; concomitant dexamethasone was allowed with schedule B). Patients had received an average of 4.9 and 7.3 prior treatment regimens (schedules A and B, respectively). MRZ schedule A was administered to 32 patients, and the RP2D was established as 0.7 mg/m(2) infused over 10 minutes. Schedule B was administered to 36 patients, and the RP2D was determined to be 0.5 mg/m(2) infused over 2 hours. The most common ({\textgreater}20\% of patients) related adverse events were fatigue, headache, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and vomiting. Six patients achieved clinical benefit responses (defined as minimal response or better), including 5 partial responses (1 patient on schedule A and 4 on schedule B; 3 of these 4 patients received concomitant dexamethasone).

The proteasome inhibitor marizomib (MRZ) has inhibitory and death-inducing properties unique from previous inhibitors such as bortezomib (BTZ), and has not been well examined in GBM. We evaluated the mechanism of death and in vivo properties of MRZ in GBM. The activation kinetics of initiator caspases 2, 8, and 9 were assessed using chemical and knockdown strategies to determine their contribution to cell death. Blood brain barrier permeance and proteasome inhibition by MRZ and BTZ were examined in an orthotopic GBM model. Blockade of caspase 9, relative to other caspases, was most protective against both MRZ and BTZ. Only MRZ increased the proteasome substrate p27 in orthotopic brain tumors after a single injection, while both MRZ and BTZ increased p21 levels after multiple treatments. Cleavage of caspase substrate lamin A was increased in orthotopic brain tumors from mice treated with MRZ or BTZ and the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat. Our data indicate that MRZ induces caspase 9-dependent death in GBM, suggesting drug efficacy biomarkers and possible resistance mechanisms. MRZ reaches orthotopic brain tumors where it inhibits proteasome function and increases death in combination with vorinostat.},

This fundamental practice within clinical oncology limits optimization of a treatment regimen for an individual patient, as well as to determine in real time whether the choice was in fact appropriate. This is especially frustrating at a time when a panoply of molecularly targeted therapies is available, and precision genetic or proteomic analyses of tumors are an established reality. By learning from the methods of weather and climate modeling, we submit that the forecasting power of biophysical and biomathematical modeling can be harnessed to hasten the arrival of a field of predictive oncology.

	abstract = {e21023  Background: In some solid cancers a  survival benefit has been observed for patients who had  chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The prognostic impact of baseline and nadir blood neutrophils was assessed in the present study. Methods: Data on patients with breast cancer st.I-IV, ovarian cancer st.I-IV, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) st.II-IV, and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) treated from 1997 to 2005 at Westmead Hospital, Sydney, with complete medical records of the first 3 cycles of chemotherapy and a full set of baseline and nadir laboratory data were collected from patient medical files.Survival data were updated 2010. Results: A total of 819 patients were identified, comprising 507 patients with breast cancer, 118 patients with ovarian cancer, 115 patients with NSCLC and 79 patients with SCLC. Median survival for ovarian cancer patients obtaining nadir neutropenia below 2.0 x 109/l was 56 months. In contrast, median survival for ovarian cancer patients who had nadir neutropenia above 2.0 was 27 months. In a multivariate analysis, adjusting for well-known prognostic features, nadir neutropenia below 2.0 was statistically significant (HR 1.73;p=0.03). In patients with NSCLC, baseline elevated neutrophil count was associated with short survival (p{\textless} 0.00001). The subgroup of NSCLC patients with baseline neutrophils above median value (5.9) had significantly improved survival if they obtained nadir neutropenia below 2.0 (median survival 13.4 vs 8.8 mo, p=0.041). On the contrary, in the subgroup of NSCLC patients with baseline neutrophils below median value, nadir neutropenia did not impact survival. Finally, no impact of nadir neutropenia on survival was observed for SCLC or breast cancer patients. Conclusions: Chemotherapy-induced nadir neutropenia was significantly associated with improved overall survival in patients with ovarian cancer and the subgroup of NSCLC with baseline elevated neutrophils, whereas no significant impact was observed in small cell lung cancer or breast cancer in this cohort of patients. The prognostic impact of nadir neutropenia in ovarian and non small cell lung cancer should be confirmed in larger prospective trials.},

	abstract = {Programmed cell death protein-1/ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) blockade is effective in a subset of patients with several tumor types, but predicting patient benefit using approved diagnostics is inexact, as some patients with PD-L1-negative tumors also show clinical benefit1,2. Moreover, all biopsy-based tests are subject to the errors and limitations of invasive tissue collection3–11. Preclinical studies of positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging with antibodies to PD-L1 suggested that this imaging method might be an approach to selecting patients12,13. Such a technique, however, requires substantial clinical development and validation. Here we present the initial results from a first-in-human study to assess the feasibility of imaging with zirconium-89-labeled atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1), including biodistribution, and secondly test its potential to predict response to PD-L1 blockade (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT02453984 and NCT02478099). We imaged 22 patients across three tumor types before the start of atezolizumab therapy. The PET signal, a function of tracer exposure and target expression, was high in lymphoid tissues and at sites of inflammation. In tumors, uptake was generally high but heterogeneous, varying within and among lesions, patients, and tumor types. Intriguingly, clinical responses in our patients were better correlated with pretreatment PET signal than with immunohistochemistry- or RNA-sequencing-based predictive biomarkers, encouraging further development of molecular PET imaging for assessment of PD-L1 status and clinical response prediction.},

	abstract = {Immunologic responses to anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma patients occur rapidly with pharmacodynamic T cell responses detectable in blood by 3 weeks. It is unclear, however, whether these early blood-based observations translate to the tumor microenvironment. We conducted a study of neoadjuvant/adjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy in stage III/IV melanoma. We hypothesized that immune reinvigoration in the tumor would be detectable at 3 weeks and that this response would correlate with disease-free survival. We identified a rapid and potent anti-tumor response, with 8 of 27 patients experiencing a complete or major pathological response after a single dose of anti-PD-1, all of whom remain disease free. These rapid pathologic and clinical responses were associated with accumulation of exhausted CD8 T cells in the tumor at 3 weeks, with reinvigoration in the blood observed as early as 1 week. Transcriptional analysis demonstrated a pretreatment immune signature (neoadjuvant response signature) that was associated with clinical benefit. In contrast, patients with disease recurrence displayed mechanisms of resistance including immune suppression, mutational escape, and/or tumor evolution. Neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 treatment is effective in high-risk resectable stage III/IV melanoma. Pathological response and immunological analyses after a single neoadjuvant dose can be used to predict clinical outcome and to dissect underlying mechanisms in checkpoint blockade.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Drug development in oncology is resource intensive, time consuming, and frequently unsuccessful. Here, we hypothesized that therapeutic benefit of published phase I studies of antimyeloma investigational agents was associated with advancement to phase II and future regulatory approval.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy four phase I trials that treated patients with multiple myeloma (n = 2,408) conducted from 2004 to 2015 were analyzed to assess drug safety, efficacy, phase advancement, and regulatory approval.
RESULTS: The median overall response rate (ORR) for all single-agent trials evaluated was 13.2\%. However, the ORR in trials that advanced to phase II was 19\%, whereas it was only 4\% in trials that failed to advance. The median ORR was 23\% for trials testing agents that were ultimately approved by the US Food and Drug Administration compared with only 8\% for trials testing agents that were not approved (hazard ratio, 2.21; 95\% CI, 2.01 to 2.61; P = .012). Importantly, the absolute number of phase I trials in multiple myeloma, but not the success rate, significantly increased over the period studied. The proportion of industry-sponsored trials also steadily increased over that same period. The ratio of initial dose to maximum tolerated dose was 0.29, suggesting that many patients were undertreated.
CONCLUSION: Investigational agents with higher ORRs in phase I trials were more likely to advance to phase II trials and achieve US Food and Drug Administration approval. Our results suggest that designing phase I trials to maximize the antimyeloma efficacy of a given compound may lead to more successful and cost-effective drug development.},

Eligibility included endocrine-refractory, estrogen receptor–positive metastatic breast cancer. An accelerated titration schedule was applied until moderate or dose-limiting toxicity occurred, followed by a 3+3 design and expansion at 40, 80, and 100 mg per day. Tumor DNA from serum (circulating cell free [cf); all patients] and biopsies [160 mg/day and expansion]) was sequenced.ResultsOf 41 enrolled patients, 38 were evaluable for MTD determination. Prior endocrine regimens during which progression occurred included aromatase inhibitor (n = 36), fulvestrant (n = 21), and tamoxifen (n = 15). Patients received endoxifen once daily at seven dose levels (20 to 160 mg). Dose escalation ceased at 160 mg per day given lack of MTD and endoxifen concentrations {\textgreater} 1,900 ng/mL. Endoxifen clearance was unaffected by CYP2D6 genotype. One patient (60 mg) had cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicity (pulmonary embolus). Overall clinical benefit rate (stable {\textgreater} 6 months [n = 7] or partial response by RECIST criteria [n = 3]) was 26.3\% (95\% CI, 13.4\% to 43.1\%) including prior tamoxifen progression (n = 3). cfDNA mutations were observed in 13 patients (PIK3CA [n = 8], ESR1 [n = 5], TP53 [n = 4], and AKT [n = 1]) with shorter progression-free survival (v those without cfDNA mutations; median, 61 v 132 days; log-rank P = .046). Clinical benefit was observed in those with ESR1 amplification (tumor; 80 mg/day) and ESR1 mutation (cfDNA; 160 mg/day). Comparing tumor biopsies and cfDNA, some mutations (PIK3CA, TP53, and AKT) were undetected by cfDNA, whereas cfDNA mutations (ESR1, TP53, and AKT) were undetected by biopsy.ConclusionIn endocrine-refractory metastatic breast cancer, Z-endoxifen provides substantial drug exposure unaffected by CYP2D6 metabolism, acceptable toxicity, and promising antitumor activity.},

Methods: We collected data from 87 patients in two expert centers who received at least two cycles of trabectedin for soft tissue sarcomas (STS) treatment. Correlations between ANC, patients' characteristics, and survival were assessed, and a multivariate model including tumor grade, performance status, ANC, and hemoglobin level was developed. Results: Therapeutic ANC ≥ 7.5 G/L level was associated with shorter PFS: 3.22 months (95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.57⁻4.87) in patients with ANC ≥ 7.5 G/L vs. 5.78 months (95\% CI, 3.95⁻7.61) in patients with ANC {\textless} 7.5 G/L (p = 0.009). Age, primary localization, lung metastases, dose reduction, hemoglobin, and albumin rates were also associated with PFS. In multivariate analysis, ANC ≥ 7.5 G/L was independently associated with poor PFS and overall survival. Conclusion: We validated increased pre-therapeutic ANC as a predictive factor of short PFS in patients starting trabectedin for STS. ANC appears to have an impact on survival rates and may be used as a decision-making tool for personalizing second-line strategies in patients with metastatic STS.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous (iv) diflomotecan administered once every 3 weeks, and to characterize the relationship between pharmacokinetics and neutropenic effect, using a semi-mechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-four patients received a total of 75 cycles of iv diflomotecan that was administered as 20-min infusion, once every 3 weeks at escalating doses of 2, 4, 5, and 6 mg/m2. Haematological and non-haematological toxicities were evaluated. Plasma concentrations of diflomotecan were measured after the first drug administration.
RESULTS: Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) following the first cycle occurred in 12 patients and a total of 16 patients experienced DLT at some point in the trial. During the first cycle of treatment the number of patients in the 5 and 6 mg/m2 dose groups that experienced DLT was 3 of 4, and 3 of 3, respectively. Therefore, the dose of 5 mg/m2 was considered the MTD and the dose of 4 mg/m2 the recommended dose (RD). During the first cycle, 12 patients experienced DLT, six had either infection of haematological toxicity and eight complained of fatigue. The best response was a partial response in one patient treated at the 6 mg/m2 dose level. Disease stabilization was observed in seven patients (four patients treated at 4 mg/m2 and one patient at each dose level of 2, 5, and 6 mg/m2). The remaining patients had all progressive disease. The median time to progression for all patients was 5.9 weeks. Pharmacokinetics of diflomotecan was described with a three-compartmental model. Mean population parameter estimates of the apparent volume of distribution of the central compartment (V c) increased linearly with body surface area (BSA) as: V c (L) = 41.5 x (BSA/1.85), and the mean population estimate of the apparent volume of distribution of the shallow compartment was lower in females (29.5 vs 48.8 L). Computer simulations showed the lack of clinical significance of these covariates. The time course of the neutropenic response was adequately described by a semi-mechanistic model that includes cellular processes and drug effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The MTD and RD after a 20-min iv infusion of diflomotecan every 3 weeks are 4 and 5 mg/m2, respectively. Diflomotecan showed linear pharmacokinetic behaviour and the selected PK/PD model described adequately the time course of neutropenia. The mean model predicted values of nadir and time to nadir after a 20-min iv infusion of 4 mg/m2 of diflomotecan was 0.86 x 10(9) /L neutrophil cell counts and 11 days, respectively.},

	abstract = {Late-onset toxicity is common for novel molecularly targeted agents and immunotherapy. It causes major logistic difficulty for existing adaptive phase I trial designs, which require the observance of toxicity early enough to apply dose-escalation rules for new patients. The same logistic difficulty arises when the accrual is rapid. We propose the time-to-event Bayesian optimal interval (TITE-BOIN) design to accelerate phase I trials by allowing for real-time dose assignment decisions for new patients while some enrolled patients' toxicity data are still pending. Similar to the rolling six design, the TITE-BOIN dose-escalation/deescalation rule can be tabulated before the trial begins, making it transparent and simple to implement, but is more flexible in choosing the target dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate and has higher accuracy to identify the MTD. Compared with the more complicated model-based time-to-event continuous reassessment method (TITE-CRM), the TITE-BOIN has comparable accuracy to identify the MTD but is simpler to implement with substantially better overdose control. As the TITE-CRM is more aggressive in dose escalation, it is less likely to underdose patients. When there are no pending data, the TITE-BOIN seamlessly reduces to the BOIN design. Numerical studies show that the TITE-BOIN design supports continuous accrual without sacrificing patient safety or the accuracy of identifying the MTD, and therefore has great potential to accelerate early-phase drug development.

To address this issue, we propose the data augmentation continual re-assessment method (DA-CRM) for dose finding. By naturally treating the unobserved toxicities as missing data, we show that such missing data are nonignorable in the sense that the missingness depends on the unobserved outcomes. The Bayesian data augmentation approach is used to sample both the missing data and model parameters from their posterior full conditional distributions. We evaluate the performance of the DA-CRM through extensive simulation studies, and also compare it with other existing methods. The results show that the proposed design satisfactorily resolves the issues related to late-onset toxicities and possesses desirable operating characteristics: treating patients more safely, and also selecting the maximum tolerated dose with a higher probability. The new DA-CRM is illustrated with two phase I cancer clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Adoptive T-cell therapy, incorporating engineered T cell receptors (TCRs) or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), target tumor antigens with high affinity and specificity. To increase the potency of adoptively transferred T cells, patients are conditioned with lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimens prior to adoptive T-cell transfer (ACT), and data suggest that fludarabine is an important component of an effective regimen. In a recent clinical trial using CAR-T cells engineered to target the CD19 B-cell antigen to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia, JCAR-015 (NCT02535364), two patient deaths due to cerebral edema led to trial suspension. The lymphodepleting agent fludarabine was suggested as the causative agent, in part due to its known association with neurotoxicity and its ability to induce greater potency. In a similar CAR-T study also incorporating fludarabine in the preconditioning regimen, ZUMA-1 (NCT02348216), one patient died of cerebral edema. However, subsequent deaths in the JCAR-015 study after removal of fludarabine and improved understanding behind the mechanisms of CAR-T-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES) indicate that fludarabine is not the primary causative agent of cerebral edema and that it can be safely incorporated into the preconditioning regimen for ACT. Since entering clinical use in the late 1980s as a chemotherapy agent, fludarabine and similar analogs have been associated with lethal neurological toxicity, yet the manifestation and timing of symptoms are distinct to those observed recently in ACT. Herein, we review the history of fludarabine development as a chemotherapeutic agent, and discuss the safety of its continued use in preconditioning regimens for ACT.},

Acute neurologic signs and/or symptoms occur in a significant proportion of patients treated with CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor-T cells for B-cell malignancies. Clinical manifestations include headache, confusion, delirium, language disturbance, seizures and rarely, acute cerebral edema. Neurotoxicity is associated with cytokine release syndrome, which occurs in the setting of in-vivo chimeric antigen receptor-T cell activation and proliferation. The mechanisms that lead to neurotoxicity remain unknown, but data from patients and animal models suggest there is compromise of the blood-brain barrier, associated with high levels of cytokines in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as endothelial activation. Corticosteroids, interleukin-6-targeted therapies, and supportive care are frequently used to manage patients with neurotoxicity, but high-quality evidence of their efficacy is lacking.},

However, a parallel enhancement of the undesired effects might take place as well, resulting in a limited therapeutic usefulness. Therefore, when addressing the question of optimal drug combinations, side effects must be taken into account.
METHODS: By extension of a previously published interaction model, the authors propose a method to study drug interactions considering also their side effects. A general outcome parameter identified as patient's well-being is defined by superposition of positive and negative effects. Well-being response surfaces are computed and analyzed for varying drugs pharmacodynamics and interaction types. In particular, the existence of multiple maxima and of optimal drug combinations is investigated for the combination of two drugs.
RESULTS: Both drug pharmacodynamics and interaction type affect the well-being surface and the deriving optimal combinations. The effect of the interaction parameters can be explained in terms of synergy and antagonism and remains unchanged for varying pharmacodynamics. For all simulations performed for the combination of two drugs, the presence of more than one maximum was never observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The model is consistent with clinical knowledge and supports previously published experimental results on optimal drug combinations. This new framework improves understanding of the characteristics of drug combinations used in clinical practice and can be used in clinical research to identify optimal drug dosing.},

Vascular normalization following bevacizumab administration may transiently enhance drug delivery, suggesting improved efficacy with sequential administration. To investigate optimal scheduling, we conducted a study in NSCLC-bearing mice. First, experiments demonstrated improved efficacy when using sequential vs. concomitant scheduling of bevacizumab and chemotherapy. Combining this data with a mathematical model of tumor growth under therapy accounting for the normalization effect, we predicted an optimal delay of 2.8 days between bevacizumab and chemotherapy. This prediction was confirmed experimentally, with reduced tumor growth of 38\% as compared to concomitant scheduling, and prolonged survival (74 vs. 70 days). Alternate sequencing of 8 days failed in achieving a similar increase in efficacy, thus emphasizing the utility of modeling support to identify optimal scheduling. The model could also be a useful tool in the clinic to personally tailor regimen sequences.},

When patients are under chemotherapy, despite the huge amount of blood monitoring numerations, there is a lack of exposure variables to describe hematotoxicity linked with the circulating drug blood levels. We developed an interface model that transforms circulating pharmacokinetic concentrations to adequate exposures, destined to be inputs of the pharmacodynamic process. The model is materialized by a nonlinear differential equation involving three parameters. The relevance of the interface model for dosage adjustment is illustrated by numerous simulations. In particular, the interface model is incorporated into a complex system including pharmacokinetics and neutropenia induced by docetaxel and by cisplatin. Emphasis is placed on the sensitivity of neutropenia with respect to the variations of the drug amount. This complex system including pharmacokinetic, interface, and pharmacodynamic hematotoxicity models is an interesting tool for analysis of hematotoxicity induced by anticancer agents.

	abstract = {The general utility of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) paradigm, a strategy aimed at optimizing the chance of total tumor cell eradication, is here questioned. Evidence to date suggests that for many tumors the potential for eradication is in fact remote, with patients consistently demonstrating tumor cell presence subsequent to MTD treatments having eradicative intent. The failure to eradicate is attributed largely to the heterogeneous nature of the tumor. Heterogeneous cell populations demonstrate short-term refractoriness to up-front dose delivery, but "resensitize" as part of dose recovery, showing increased overall susceptibility to a given series of doses when delivered more evenly spaced. It is demonstrated: (1) that the minimization of total tumor burden, rather than complete eradication, may often be the more practical objective; and (2) that regularly spaced, "metronomic" dosing is the best way to achieve it. As a corollary, it is found that the more efficient ability of the tumor endothelial cells to resensitize following dosing predicts a targeting bias towards the endothelial compartment of a tumor when metronomic dosing is employed. This lends theoretical support to recent empirical studies showing that regularly spaced dosing schedules with no extended rest periods act more antiangiogenically, thereby delaying or avoiding the onset of acquired resistance.},

The cost of the drug is nonlinearly defined in or objective functional and linearly defined in the other. Existence and uniqueness for the optimal control problems are analyzed. Each of the optimality systems, which consists of the state systen coupled with the adjoint system, is characterized. Finally, numerical results show that there are qualitatively different treatment schemes for each model studied.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the risk of hospitalization between patients with early-stage breast cancer who received different chemotherapy regimens.
PATIENT AND METHODS: We identified 3,567 patients older than age 65 years from the SEER/Texas Cancer Registry-Medicare database and 9,327 patients younger than age 65 years from the MarketScan database who were diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer between 2003 and 2007. The selection was nonrandomized and nonprospectively collected. We categorized patients according to the regimens they received: docetaxel (T) and cyclophosphamide (C), doxorubicin (A) and C, TAC, AC + T, dose-dense AC + paclitaxel (P) or AC + weekly P. We compared the rates of chemotherapy-related hospitalizations that occurred within 6 months of chemotherapy initiation and used multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with these hospitalizations.
RESULTS: Among patients younger than age 65 years, the hospitalization rates ranged from 6.2\% (dose-dense AC + P) to 10.0\% (TAC), and those who received TAC and AC + T had significantly higher rates of hospitalization than did patients who received TC. Among patients older than age 65 years, these rates ranged from 12.7\% (TC) to 24.2\% (TAC) and the rates of hospitalization of patients who received TAC, AC + T, AC, or AC + weekly P were higher than those of patients who received TC.
CONCLUSION: TAC and AC + T were associated with the highest risk of hospitalization in patients younger than age 65 years. Among patients older than age 65 years, all regimens (aside from dose-dense AC + P) were associated with a higher risk of hospitalization than TC. Results may be affected by selection biases where less aggressive regimens are offered to frailer patients.},

	abstract = {The dosing of combination therapies is commonly undertaken empirically by practising physicians, and a coherent algorithm to approach the problem of combination dosing is currently lacking. Current methods of evaluating multiple drug combinations in clinical trials fail to provide information regarding the location of more effective doses when the combination is not found to differ from the standard, even though the absence of a difference does not necessarily mean the new combination is ineffective. Moreover, in studies where the new combination is found more effective, often a large proportion of the study participants obtain no benefit from the trial. Even with early stopping rules, the time these subjects spend on inferior treatments can have lasting detrimental effects, leading to problems with patient enrolment and adherence to study protocol. This paper describes an evolutionary operation (EVOP) direct-search procedure to titrate combination doses within individual patients. The Nelder-Mead simplex direct-search algorithm is used to titrate combinations of drugs within individual subjects. Desirability functions are utilized to define the main response of interest and additional responses or constraints. Statistical methodology for determining whether the titrated treatment combination has resulted in an improvement in subject response and for evaluating for therapeutic synergism is developed. Inferences can then be made about the efficacy of the combination or about the individual drugs that comprise the combination. The advantages of this approach include affording every patient the potential to benefit from the combination under study and permitting the consideration of multiple endpoints simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Oncology has benefited from an increasingly growing number of groundbreaking innovations over the last decade. Targeted therapies, biotherapies, and the most recent immunotherapies all contribute to increase the number of therapeutic options for cancer patients. Consequently, substantial improvements in clinical outcomes for some disease with dismal prognosis such as lung carcinoma or melanoma have been achieved. Of note, the latest innovations in targeted therapies or biotherapies do not preclude the use of standard cytotoxic agents, mostly used in combination. Importantly, and despite the rise of bioguided (a.k.a. precision) medicine, the administration of chemotherapeutic agents still relies on the maximum tolerated drug (MTD) paradigm, a concept inherited from theories conceptualized nearly half a century ago. Alternative dosing schedules such as metronomic regimens, based upon the repeated and regular administration of low doses of chemotherapeutic drugs, and adaptive therapy (i.e. modulating the dose and frequency of cytotoxics administration to control disease progression rather than eradicate it at all cost) have emerged as possible strategies to improve response rates while reducing toxicities. The recent changes in paradigm in the way we theorize cancer biology and evolution, metastatic spreading and tumor ecology, alongside the recent advances in the field of immunotherapy, have considerably strengthened the interest for these alternative approaches. This paper aims at reviewing the recent evolutions in the field of theoretical biology of cancer and computational oncology, with a focus on the consequences these changes have on the way we administer chemotherapy. Here, we advocate for the development of model-guided strategies to refine doses and schedules of chemotherapy administration in order to achieve precision medicine in oncology.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Using a 2 x 2 factorial design, we studied the adjuvant chemotherapy of women with axillary node-positive breast cancer to compare sequential doxorubicin (A), paclitaxel (T), and cyclophosphamide (C) with concurrent doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by paclitaxel (T) for disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS); to determine whether the dose density of the agents improves DFS and OS; and to compare toxicities.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 2,005 female patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the following regimens: (I) sequential A x 4 (doses) --{\textgreater} T x 4 --{\textgreater} C x 4 with doses every 3 weeks, (II) sequential A x 4 --{\textgreater} T x 4 --{\textgreater} C x 4 every 2 weeks with filgrastim, (III) concurrent AC x 4 --{\textgreater} T x 4 every 3 weeks, or (IV) concurrent AC x 4 --{\textgreater} T x 4 every 2 weeks with filgrastim.
RESULTS: A protocol-specified analysis was performed at a median follow-up of 36 months: 315 patients had experienced relapse or died, compared with 515 expected treatment failures. Dose-dense treatment improved the primary end point, DFS (risk ratio [RR] = 0.74; P =.010), and OS (RR = 0.69; P =.013). Four-year DFS was 82\% for the dose-dense regimens and 75\% for the others. There was no difference in either DFS or OS between the concurrent and sequential schedules. There was no interaction between density and sequence. Severe neutropenia was less frequent in patients who received the dose-dense regimens.
CONCLUSION: Dose density improves clinical outcomes significantly, despite the lower than expected number of events at this time. Sequential chemotherapy is as effective as concurrent chemotherapy.},

We expanded the meaning of the interaction index, and propose a procedure to calculate the interaction index and its associated confidence interval under the assumption that the dose-effect curve for a single agent follows Chou and Talalay's median effect equation. In addition, we review four response surface models based on the Loewe additivity model using a single parameter to determine drug interactions. We describe each of these models in the context of Loewe additivity model and discuss their relative advantages and disadvantages.

For a univariate endpoint, this implies that the combination at specific doses must be superior to each of its components at the same doses. More demanding is the property of synergy, in which the effect of the combination must be superior to the effect expected based on those of its components. If it is equal to those effects, it is additive, and if it is inferior, it is antagonistic. We give regions in the combination dose plane where these concepts are well defined. If the effect of the combination is greater than the greatest effect achievable by any of its components it is therapeutically synergistic. A combination can be antagonistic, yet its components can still contribute to the claimed effects. If it is additive, synergistic or therapeutically synergistic, its components must contribute to the claimed effects.

Thus, it will almost certainly be necessary to use new 'targeted' pharmaceuticals in combinations. Multicomponent drugs are standard in cytotoxic chemotherapy, but their development has required arduous empirical testing. However, experimentally validated numerical models should greatly aid in the formulation of new combination therapies, particularly those tailored to the needs of specific patients. This perspective focuses on opportunities and challenges inherent in the application of mathematical modeling and systems approaches to pharmacology, specifically with respect to the idea of achieving combinatorial selectivity through use of multicomponent drugs.},

	abstract = {For decades, the standard procedure when screening for candidate anticancer drug combinations has been to search for synergy, defined as any positive deviation from trivial cases like when the drugs are regarded as diluted versions of each other (Loewe additivity), independent actions (Bliss independence), or no interaction terms in a response surface model (no interaction). Here, we show that this kind of conventional synergy analysis may be completely misleading when the goal is to detect if there is a promising in vitro therapeutic window. Motivated by this result, and the fact that a drug combination offering a promising therapeutic window seldom is interesting if one of its constituent drugs can provide the same window alone, the largely overlooked concept of therapeutic synergy (TS) is reintroduced. In vitro TS is said to occur when the largest therapeutic window obtained by the best drug combination cannot be achieved by any single drug within the concentration range studied. Using this definition of TS, we introduce a procedure that enables its use in modern massively parallel experiments supported by a statistical omnibus test for TS designed to avoid the multiple testing problem. Finally, we suggest how one may perform TS analysis, via computational predictions of the reference cell responses, when only the target cell responses are available. In conclusion, the conventional error-prone search for promising drug combinations may be improved by replacing conventional (toxicology-rooted) synergy analysis with an analysis focused on (clinically motivated) TS.},

Typically, the combination effect is declared synergistic if Y(O) is greater than Y(P). However, this method lacks statistical rigor because it does not take into account the variability of the response measures and can frequently cause false-positive claims. In this article, we introduce a two-stage response surface model to describe the drug interaction across all dose combinations tested. This new method enables robust statistical testing for synergism at any dose combination, thus reducing the risk of false positives. The use of the method is illustrated through an application describing statistically significant "synergy regions" for candidate drug combinations targeting epidermal growth factor receptor and the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor.},

Although their single-drug components are well studied, the mechanisms by which drugs work together in clinical combination regimens are poorly understood. Here, we combine RNAi-based functional signatures with complementary informatics tools to examine drug combinations. This approach seeks to bring to combination therapy what the knowledge of biochemical targets has brought to single-drug therapy and creates a statistical and experimental definition of "combination drug mechanisms of action." We show that certain synergistic drug combinations may act as a more potent version of a single drug. Conversely, unlike these highly synergistic combinations, most drugs average extant single-drug variations in therapeutic response. When combined to form multidrug regimens, averaging combinations form averaging regimens that homogenize genetic variation in mouse models of cancer and in clinical genomics datasets. We suggest surprisingly simple and predictable combination mechanisms of action that are independent of biochemical mechanism and have implications for biomarker discovery as well as for the development of regimens with defined genetic dependencies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both total dose and dose intensity of adjuvant chemotherapy are postulated to be important variables in the outcome for patients with operable breast cancer. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B study 8541 examined the effects of adjuvant treatment using conventional-range dose and dose intensity in female patients with stage II (axillary lymph node-positive) breast cancer.
METHODS: Within 6 weeks of surgery (radical mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, or lumpectomy), 1550 patients with unilateral breast cancer were randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms: high-, moderate-, or low-dose intensity. The patients received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, with 5-fluorouracil administration repeated on day 8. The high-dose arm had twice the dose intensity and twice the drug dose as the low-dose arm. The moderate-dose arm had two thirds the dose intensity as the high-dose arm but the same total drug dose. Disease-free survival and overall survival were primary end points of the study.
RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 9 years, disease-free survival and overall survival for patients on the moderate- and high-dose arms are superior to the corresponding survival measures for patients on the low-dose arm (two-sided P{\textless}.0001 and two-sided P = .004, respectively), with no difference in disease-free or overall survival between the moderate- and the high-dose arms. At 5 years, overall survival (average +/- standard error) is 79\% +/- 2\% for patients on the high-dose arm, 77\% +/- 2\% for the patients on the moderate-dose arm, and 72\% +/- 2\% for patients on the low-dose arm; disease-free survival is 66\% +/- 2\%, 61\% +/- 2\%, and 56\% +/- 2\%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Within the conventional dose range for this chemotherapy regimen, a higher dose is associated with better disease-free survival and overall survival.},

The objectives of this study were to analyze the relationship between these two variables and to propose a unified conceptual framework for the construct and interpretation of clinical trials. Definitions and variables with respect to dose include potency, therapeutic index, standard dose, efficacy, relative efficacy, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), dose rate, dose density, dose intensity, and fractional dose intensity. Our overarching concept, that is, summation dose intensity (SDI), was calculated in several ways, depending upon the nature of the data, and included the relative efficacy method, the unit regimen method, and the high dose method. The SDI concept was then applied to disease categories and strategies to determine its usefulness and effectiveness in integrating dose and combinations. The tumors and settings were: mustargen-vincristine-procarbazine-prednisone in Hodgkin's disease, combination chemotherapy for acute lymphocytic leukemia in children, metastatic breast cancer including dose and combinations, selected other solid tumors, alternating chemotherapy, and high dose studies in the leukemias and lymphomas. SDI was effective in integrating and quantifying dose and combination chemotherapy. For classical AAs, the implication of SDI for the construct and analysis of clinical trials was emphasized. In addition to new drug development, emphasis should be given to reducing or eliminating DLTs, such as those of the marrow, now and, in the future, those of the gastrointestinal tract toxicity and other DLTs. The above was derived from and applies to the classical AAs. Whether they will apply to, with appropriate adjustment, agents with significantly different dose-response curves, such as biotherapeutics and hormonal agents, remains to be determined.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: PIK3CA mutations occur in approximately 40\% of patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. The PI3Kα-specific inhibitor alpelisib has shown antitumor activity in early studies.
METHODS: In a randomized, phase 3 trial, we compared alpelisib (at a dose of 300 mg per day) plus fulvestrant (at a dose of 500 mg every 28 days and once on day 15) with placebo plus fulvestrant in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously. Patients were enrolled into two cohorts on the basis of tumor-tissue PIK3CA mutation status. The primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed by the investigator, in the cohort with PIK3CA-mutated cancer; progression-free survival was also analyzed in the cohort without PIK3CA-mutated cancer. Secondary end points included overall response and safety.
RESULTS: A total of 572 patients underwent randomization, including 341 patients with confirmed tumor-tissue PIK3CA mutations. In the cohort of patients with PIK3CA-mutated cancer, progression-free survival at a median follow-up of 20 months was 11.0 months (95\% confidence interval [CI], 7.5 to 14.5) in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 5.7 months (95\% CI, 3.7 to 7.4) in the placebo-fulvestrant group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.50 to 0.85; P{\textless}0.001); in the cohort without PIK3CA-mutated cancer, the hazard ratio was 0.85 (95\% CI, 0.58 to 1.25; posterior probability of hazard ratio {\textless}1.00, 79.4\%). Overall response among all the patients in the cohort without PIK3CA-mutated cancer was greater with alpelisib-fulvestrant than with placebo-fulvestrant (26.6\% vs. 12.8\%); among patients with measurable disease in this cohort, the percentages were 35.7\% and 16.2\%, respectively. In the overall population, the most frequent adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were hyperglycemia (36.6\% in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group vs. 0.7\% in the placebo-fulvestrant group) and rash (9.9\% vs. 0.3\%). Diarrhea of grade 3 occurred in 6.7\% of patients in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 0.3\% of those in the placebo-fulvestrant group; no diarrhea of grade 4 was reported. The percentages of patients who discontinued alpelisib and placebo owing to adverse events were 25.0\% and 4.2\%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with alpelisib-fulvestrant prolonged progression-free survival among patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received endocrine therapy previously.

Patients and Methods In the dose-escalation phase, patients with PIK3CA-altered advanced solid tumors received once-daily or twice-daily oral alpelisib on a continuous schedule. In the dose-expansion phase, patients with PIK3CA-altered solid tumors and PIK3CA-wild-type, estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer received alpelisib 400 mg once daily. Results One hundred thirty-four patients received treatment. Alpelisib maximum tolerated doses were established as 400 mg once daily and 150 mg twice daily. Nine patients (13.2\%) in the dose-escalation phase had dose-limiting toxicities of hyperglycemia (n = 6), nausea (n = 2), and both hyperglycemia and hypophosphatemia (n = 1). Frequent all-grade, treatment-related adverse events included hyperglycemia (51.5\%), nausea (50.0\%), decreased appetite (41.8\%), diarrhea (40.3\%), and vomiting (31.3\%). Alpelisib was rapidly absorbed; half-life was 7.6 hours at 400 mg once daily with minimal accumulation. Objective tumor responses were observed at doses ≥ 270 mg once daily; overall response rate was 6.0\% (n = 8; one patient with endometrial cancer had a complete response, and seven patients with cervical, breast, endometrial, colon, and rectal cancers had partial responses). Stable disease was achieved in 70 (52.2\%) patients and was maintained {\textgreater} 24 weeks in 13 (9.7\%) patients; disease control rate (complete and partial responses and stable disease) was 58.2\%. In patients with estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer, median progression-free survival was 5.5 months. Frequently mutated genes (≥ 10\% tumors) included TP53 (51.3\%), APC (23.7\%), KRAS (22.4\%), ARID1A (13.2\%), and FBXW7 (10.5\%). Conclusion Alpelisib demonstrated a tolerable safety profile and encouraging preliminary activity in patients with PIK3CA-altered solid tumors, supporting the rationale for selective PI3Kα inhibition in combination with other agents for the treatment of PIK3CA-mutant tumors.},

	abstract = {Importance: The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is frequently activated in patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), endocrine therapy-resistant breast cancers.
Objective: To assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, and activity of alpelisib, an oral, PI3Kα-specific inhibitor, plus fulvestrant in patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer (ABC).
Design, Setting, and Participants: An open-label, single-arm, phase 1b study of alpelisib plus fulvestrant was conducted at 10 centers in 5 countries. Participants were 87 postmenopausal women with PIK3CA-altered or PIK3CA-wild-type ER+ ABC, whose cancer progressed during or after antiestrogen therapy. The study began enrolling patients October 5, 2010, and the data cutoff was March 22, 2017.
Interventions: Escalating doses of alpelisib were administered once daily, starting at 300 mg, plus fixed-dose fulvestrant, 500 mg, in the dose-escalation phase; alpelisib at the recommended phase 2 dose plus fulvestrant in the dose-expansion phase.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was determination of the MTD of once-daily alpelisib plus fulvestrant. Secondary end points included safety and preliminary activity.
Results: From October 5, 2010, to March 22, 2017, 87 women (median age: 58 years [range, 37-79 years]; median of 5 prior lines of antineoplastic therapy) received escalating once-daily doses of alpelisib (300 mg, n = 9; 350 mg, n = 8; 400 mg, n = 70) plus fixed-dose fulvestrant (500 mg). During dose escalation, dose-limiting toxic effects were reported in 1 patient (alpelisib, 400 mg): diarrhea (grade 2), vomiting, fatigue, and decreased appetite (all grade 3). The MTD of alpelisib when combined with fulvestrant was 400 mg once daily, and the recommended phase 2 dose was 300 mg once daily. Overall, the most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events with alpelisib, 400 mg, once daily (≥10\% of patients), regardless of causality, were hyperglycemia (19 [22\%]) and maculopapular rash (11 [13\%]); 9 patients permanently discontinued therapy owing to adverse events. Median progression-free survival at the MTD was 5.4 months (95\% CI, 4.6-9.0 months). Median progression-free survival with alpelisib, 300 to 400 mg, once daily plus fulvestrant was longer in patients with PIK3CA-altered tumors (9.1 months; 95\% CI, 6.6-14.6 months) vs wild-type tumors (4.7 months; 95\% CI, 1.9-5.6 months). Overall response rate in the PIK3CA-altered group was 29\% (95\% CI, 17\%-43\%), with no objective tumor responses in the wild-type group.
Conclusions and Relevance: Alpelisib plus fulvestrant has a manageable safety profile in patients with ER+ ABC, and data suggest that this combination may have greater clinical activity in PIK3CA-altered vs wild-type tumors.

	abstract = {Motivated by our prior work on a Triple Negative breast cancer cell line, the focus of this paper is controller synthesis for cancer treatment, through the use of drug schedul- ing and a switched dynamical system model. Here we study a cyclic schedule of d drugs with maximal waiting times between drug inputs, where each drug is applied once per cycle in any order. We suppose that some of the d drugs are highly toxic to normal cells and that these drugs can shrink the live cancer cell population. The remaining drugs are less toxic to normal cells and can only reduce the growth rate of the live cancer cell population. Also, we assume that waiting time bounds related to toxicity, or to the onset of resistance, are available for each drug. A cancer cell population is said to be stable if the number of live cells tends to zero, as time becomes sufficiently large. In the absence of modeling error, we derive conditions for exponential stability. In the presence of modeling error, we prove exponential stability and derive a settling time, under certain mathematical conditions on the error. We conclude the paper with a numerical example that uses models which were identified on Triple Negative breast cancer cell line data.},

	abstract = {A classic reachability problem for safety of dy- namic systems is to compute the set of initial states from which the state trajectory is guaranteed to stay inside a given constraint set over a given time horizon. In this paper, we leverage existing theory of reachability analysis and risk measures to devise a risk-sensitive reachability approach for safety of stochastic dynamic systems under non-adversarial disturbances over a finite time horizon. Specifically, we first introduce the notion of a risk-sensitive safe set as a set of initial states from which the risk of large constraint violations can be reduced to a required level via a control policy, where risk is quantified using the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) measure. Second, we show how the computation of a risk-sensitive safe set can be reduced to the solution to a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where cost is assessed according to CVaR. Third, leveraging this reduction, we devise a tractable algorithm to approximate a risk-sensitive safe set and provide arguments about its correctness. Finally, we present a realistic example inspired from stormwater catchment design to demonstrate the utility of risk-sensitive reachability analysis. In particular, our approach allows a practitioner to tune the level of risk sensitivity from worst-case (which is typical for Hamilton- Jacobi reachability analysis) to risk-neutral (which is the case for stochastic reachability analysis).},

Therefore, it is an attractive target for administration schedule optimization. The present study leverages our previous work on BEV-PEM/CIS pharmacodynamic modeling in non-small cell lung cancer-bearing mice to estimate the optimal gap in the scheduling of sequential BEV-PEM/CIS. We predicted the optimal gap in BEV-PEM/CIS dosing to be 2.0 days in mice and 1.2 days in humans. Our simulations suggest that the efficacy loss in scheduling BEV-PEM/CIS at too great of a gap is much less than the efficacy loss in scheduling BEV-PEM/CIS at too short of a gap.},

	abstract = {The efficacy of three therapeutic programs for acute leukemia were compared. These programs included (1) Methotrexate (Phase I) followed by 6-mercaptopurine (Phase II); (2) 6-mercaptopurine (Phase I) followed by Methotrexate (Phase II); and (3) Combination Therapy, i.e., 6-mercaptopurine given in combination with Methotrexate. In children with acute lymphocytic leukemia the remission rate was 59 per cent for combination therapy, 47 per cent for 6-mercaptopurine, and 29 per cent for Methotrexate. The better remission rate for combination therapy is consistent with that predicted if it is assumed that 6-mercaptopurine and Methotrexate act independently. The median duration of complete remissions for the three treatments was not different (4 to 5 months). However, long lasting remissions were more frequent in patients receiving combination therapy. The median survival from the onset of therapy to death was 9 months. There were no differences between the three treatment programs as regards survival. In adults the remission rate was 15 per cent for combination therapy, 21 per cent for 6-mercaptopurine and 7 per cent for Methotrexate. As regards survival in adults, early deaths were more common in patients who received MTX as initial therapy, whereas after 5 months survival was somewhat better in those patients receiving combination therapy. In both children and adults there was no evidence that prior treatment with one of the antimetabolites altered response to the other antimetabolite. This result differs from those in animal models, and its effect on our concept of the mechanism of resistance is discussed. Responsiveness to the second course of antimetabolite therapy (Phase II) was as good as that to the first course of treatment. This was true for the remission rate, remission duration, and even for survival when appropriate corrections were made. Thus, responsiveness to drug therapy is maintained as the disease progresses temporally. It may be concluded therefore that new agents can be effectively studied in patients with "late" disease. Responsiveness to Phase II therapy was independent of responsiveness to Phase I. The most common and severe toxic manifestations related to the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract. There were no major differences quantitatively in the toxicity for the three treatment programs in children in spite of the fact that the drugs were given in full dosage in the combination program. Oral ulcers and a generalized erythematous rash occurred significantly more frequently in patients receiving Methotrexate. Jaundice was significantly more frequent in adults and in patients receiving 6-MP.},

	abstract = {It is often of interest to explore how dose affects the toxicity and efficacy properties of a novel treatment. In oncology, efficacy is often assessed through response, which is defined by a patient having no new tumour lesions and their tumour size shrinking by 30\%. Usually response and toxicity are analysed as binary outcomes in early phase trials. Methods have been proposed to improve the efficiency of analysing response by utilising the continuous tumour size information instead of dichotomising it. However, these methods do not allow for toxicity or for different doses. Motivated by a phase II trial testing multiple doses of a treatment against placebo, we propose a latent variable model that can estimate the probability of response and no toxicity (or other related outcomes) for different doses. We assess the confidence interval coverage and efficiency properties of the method, compared to methods that do not use the continuous tumour size, in a simulation study and the real study. The coverage is close to nominal when model assumptions are met, although can be below nominal when the model is misspecified. Compared to methods that treat response as binary, the method has confidence intervals with 30-50\% narrower widths. The method adds considerable efficiency but care must be taken that the model assumptions are reasonable.},

The expected net present value was used to quantify the financial implications of different strategies.We found that adaptive dose allocation approaches (in particular, the Bayesian general adaptive dose allocation method) usually outperformed other fixed dose allocation approaches with respect to both probability of success and dose selection. Design-adaptive approaches were more efficient than analysis-adaptive approaches. The allocation of additional resources into phase II improved the probability of success in phase III and the expected net present value. Bringing two doses forward into phase III testing also increased the probability of success and improved the expected net present value. The overall probability of success in phase III ranged from 35\% to 65\%, consistent with recent industry experience. This success rate could likely be improved with additional investment in phase II, the use of design-adaptive dose-finding designs when possible, increasing the power of phase III trials, more explicit consideration of toxicity concerns, and better dose selection.},

Conventions for interim data monitoring and decision making, particularly with regard to restricting access to data, have largely evolved based upon the needs in Phase III nonadaptive studies; as such, they may not be an ideal fit for adaptive dose-ranging studies, because of the different natures of the trials, their placement in the drug development process, and the objectives of the monitoring.

	abstract = {The double-blind placebo-controlled trial is the established standard for determining the efficacy of an experimental treatment. However, there are circumstances where the use of a placebo is unethical or impractical, and active-controlled trials are a common alternative. In an active-controlled trial, the objective is typically to show that the effect of the experimental treatment is within some prespecified margin of the control effect. The margin is often chosen specifically to guarantee 50\% or 75\% preservation of the control effect over placebo. An implicit assumption is that a higher standard of efficacy is required when a new treatment is evaluated in an active-controlled trial. In this article, we argue that standards based on margins and/or percent preservation are inherently arbitrary and lacking in objective clinical or scientific justification. The use of these ad hoc standards introduces logical inconsistencies for regulatory evaluation such that safe and effective treatments may be denied regulatory approval. We therefore argue that active-controlled trials should not require an arbitrarily higher standard of evidence than placebo-controlled trials. We discuss how “synthesis” analyses combining the results of both an active-controlled trial and one or more historical trials can address methodological challenges and provide for adequate estimation and testing of an experimental treatment effect relative to placebo.},

However, such viral load data may be subject to left censoring due to values below assay detection limits. In this situation the usual estimators for the rank correlations (based on assigning ties to the values below the detection limits) may be severely biased. We propose a multiple imputation approach using a truncated bivariate normal model for imputation. Simulation results indicate that the imputation estimates are apparently unbiased for bivariate normally distributed data and still perform well if the data are misspecified.},

In the past decades, proteasome has been witnessed as a potential target to fulfil this purpose, as evidenced by the fact that the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib was marketed in 2003. Marizomib (Salinosporamide A, NPI-0052), as a marine natural product, promises to be of high efficacy against multiple myeloma (MM), relapsed/refractory MM and other types of solid tumours. Compared with Bortezomib, it arguably has fewer severe side effects. Marizomib has been termed as orphan drug against multiple myeloma by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013 and by European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2014. As one of the second generation proteasome inhibitors (PIs), Marizomib is expected to bring about a sustained and complete therapeutic to extend cancer patients' life span. In this article, we intended to briefly review the historical developments, mechanisms, pharmacology, biosynthesis and side effects of this agent, aiming to provide concise coverage for a broad readership.

	abstract = {Hyperosmolar blood-brain barrier disruption (HBBBD), produced by infusion of mannitol into the cerebral arteries, has been used in the treatment of brain tumors to increase drug delivery to tumor and adjacent brain. However, the efficacy of HBBBD in brain tumor therapy has been controversial. The goal of this study was to measure changes in vascular permeability after HBBBD in patients with malignant brain tumors. The permeability (K1) of tumor and normal brain blood vessels was measured using rubidium-82 and positron emission tomography before and repeatedly at 8- to 15-minute intervals after HBBBD. Eighteen studies were performed in 13 patients, eight with glioblastoma multiforme and five with anaplastic astrocytoma. The HBBBD increased K1 in all patients. Baseline K1 values were 2.1 +/- 1.4 and 34.1 +/- 22.1 microl/minute/ml (+/- standard deviation) for brain and tumor, respectively. The peak absolute increases in K1 following HBBBD were 20.8 +/- 11.7 and 19.7 +/- 10.7 microl/minute/ml for brain and tumor, corresponding to percentage increases of approximately 1000\% in brain and approximately 60\% in tumor. The halftimes for return of K1 to near baseline for brain and tumor were 8.1 +/- 3.8 and 4.2 +/- 1.2 minutes, respectively. Simulations of the effects of HBBBD made using a very simple model with intraarterial methotrexate, which is exemplary of drugs with low permeability, indicate that 1) total exposure of the brain and tumor to methotrexate, as measured by the methotrexate concentration-time integral (or area under the curve), would increase with decreasing infusion duration and would be enhanced by 130\% to 200\% and by 7\% to 16\%, respectively, compared to intraarterial infusion of methotrexate alone; and 2) exposure time at concentrations above 1 microM, the minimal concentration required for the effects of methotrexate, would not be enhanced in tumor and would be enhanced by only 10\% in brain. Hyperosmolar blood-brain barrier disruption transiently increases delivery of water-soluble compounds to normal brain and brain tumors. Most of the enhancement of exposure results from trapping the drug within the blood-brain barrier, an effect of the very transient alteration of the blood-brain barrier by HBBBD. Delivery is most effective when a drug is administered within 5 to 10 minutes after disruption. However, the increased exposure and exposure time that occur with methotrexate, the permeability of which is among the lowest of the agents currently used clinically, are limited and the disproportionate increase in brain exposure, compared to tumor exposure, may alter the therapeutic index of many drugs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A phase 2 trial suggested increased overall survival and increased incidence of treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg compared with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in patients with advanced melanoma. We report a phase 3 trial comparing the benefit-risk profile of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg versus 3 mg/kg.
METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 trial was done in 87 centres in 21 countries worldwide. Patients with untreated or previously treated unresectable stage III or IV melanoma, without previous treatment with BRAF inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibitors, were randomly assigned (1:1) with an interactive voice response system by the permuted block method using block size 4 to ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg, administered by intravenous infusion for 90 min every 3 weeks for four doses. Patients were stratified by metastasis stage, previous treatment for metastatic melanoma, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. The patients, investigators, and site staff were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is completed and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01515189.
FINDINGS: Between Feb 29, and July 9, 2012, 727 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to ipilimumab 10 mg/kg (365 patients; 364 treated) or ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (362 patients; all treated). Median follow-up was 14·5 months (IQR 4·6-42·3) for the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg group and 11·2 months (4·9-29·4) for the ipilimumab 3 mg/kg group. Median overall survival was 15·7 months (95\% CI 11·6-17·8) for ipilimumab 10 mg/kg compared with 11·5 months (9·9-13·3) for ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (hazard ratio 0·84, 95\% CI 0·70-0·99; p=0·04). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea (37 [10\%] of 364 patients in the 10 mg/kg group vs 21 [6\%] of 362 patients in the 3 mg/kg group), colitis (19 [5\%] vs nine [2\%]), increased alanine aminotransferase (12 [3\%] vs two [1\%]), and hypophysitis (ten [3\%] vs seven [2\%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 133 (37\%) patients in the 10 mg/kg group and 66 (18\%) patients in the 3 mg/kg group; four (1\%) versus two ({\textless}1\%) patients died from treatment-related adverse events.
INTERPRETATION: In patients with advanced melanoma, ipilimumab 10 mg/kg resulted in significantly longer overall survival than did ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, but with increased treatment-related adverse events. Although the treatment landscape for advanced melanoma has changed since this study was initiated, the clinical use of ipilimumab in refractory patients with unmet medical needs could warrant further assessment.

	volume = {12},
	issn = {1740-7753},
	doi = {10.1177/1740774514555585},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In phase I clinical trials, the "3+3" algorithmic design has been unparalleled in its popularity. The statistical properties of the "3+3" design have been studied in the literature either in comparison with other methods or by deriving exact formulae of statistical quantities. However, there is still much to be known about its capabilities of describing and accounting for uncertainties in the observed data.
PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to provide a probabilistic support for analyzing the heuristic performance of the "3+3" design. The operating characteristics of the algorithm are computed under different hypotheses, levels of evidence, and true (or best guessed) toxicity rates. The dose-finding rules are further compared with those generated by the modified toxicity probability interval design and generalized for implementation in all "A+B" designs.
METHODS: Our likelihood method is based on the evidential paradigm. Two hypotheses are chosen to correspond to two hypothesized dose-limiting toxicity rates, for example, [Formula: see text]-unsafe versus [Formula: see text]-acceptable. Given observed toxicities per dose, the likelihood-ratio is calculated and compared to a certain k threshold (level of evidence). Under various true toxicities, the probabilities of weak evidence, favoring [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], were computed under four sets of hypotheses and several k thresholds.
RESULTS: For scenarios where the midpoint of the two hypothesized dose-limiting toxicity rates is around 0.30, and for a threshold of k = 2, the "3+3" design has a reduced probability (≈0.50) of identifying unsafe doses, but high chances of identifying acceptable doses. For more extreme scenarios targeting a relatively high or relatively low dose-limiting toxicity rate, the "3+3" design has no probabilistic support, and therefore, it should not be used. In our comparisons, the likelihood method is in agreement with the modified toxicity probability interval design for the majority of the hypothesized scenarios. Even so, based on the evidential paradigm, a "3+3" design is often incapable of providing sufficient levels of evidence of acceptability for doses under reasonable scenarios.
LIMITATIONS: Given the small sample size per dose, the levels of evidence are limited in their ability to provide strong evidence favoring either of the hypotheses.
CONCLUSION: In many situations, the "3+3" design does not treat enough patients per dose to have confidence in correct dose selection and the safety of the selected/unselected doses. This likelihood method allows consistent inferences to be made at each dose level, and evidence to be quantified regardless of cohort size. The approach can be used in phase I studies for identifying acceptably safe doses, but also for defining stopping rules in other types of dose-finding designs.},

This paradigm, however, is not suitable for some molecularly targeted agents, such as monoclonal antibodies, for which efficacy often increases initially with the dose and then plateaus. For molecularly targeted agents, the goal is to find the optimal dose, defined as the lowest safe dose that achieves the highest efficacy. We develop a Bayesian phase I/II dose-finding design to find the optimal dose. We employ a logistic model with a plateau parameter to capture the increasing-then-plateau feature of the dose-efficacy relationship. We take the weighted likelihood approach to accommodate for the case where efficacy is possibly late-onset. Based on observed data, we continuously update the posterior estimates of toxicity and efficacy probabilities and adaptively assign patients to the optimal dose. The simulation studies show that the proposed design has good operating characteristics. This method is going to be applied in more than two phase I clinical trials as no other method is available for this specific setting.

The methods generalize earlier approaches taking into account only the undesirable outcomes. Logistic regression models are used to model the two responses, which are both assumed to take a binary form. A prior distribution for the unknown model parameters is suggested and an optional safety constraint can be included. Gain functions to be maximized are formulated in terms of accurate estimation of the limits of a 'therapeutic window' or optimal treatment of the next cohort of subjects, although the approach could be applied to achieve any of a wide variety of objectives. The designs introduced are illustrated through simulation and retrospective implementation to a completed dose-escalation study.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ejca.2018.10.017},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy (IO) agents can cause late-onset immune-related adverse events (irAEs). In phase I trials, observation for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) is typically limited to the first cycle. The incidence of delayed-onset DLTs and their potential impact on dose determination have not been fully elucidated.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients enrolled in early phase IO trials at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre between August 2012 and September 2016 were retrospectively reviewed, applying trial-specific definitions for DLTs. A clinically significant AE (csAE) was defined as a treatment-related adverse event requiring corticosteroids, hormone replacement, IO delay or discontinuation.
RESULTS: A total of 352 consecutive trial enrolments in 21 early phase clinical trials were included. Two-hundred seventy-eight patients (79\%) received monotherapy and 74 (21\%) received combination IO. Two hundred sixty (74\%) patients experienced irAEs. There were two protocol-defined DLTs. Twenty (5.7\%) patients had 24 csAEs qualifying as DLTs except for occurrence after the protocol-specified DLT period. One-hundred and six (10\%) of irAEs were csAEs, including endocrine (26\%), respiratory (14\%), gastrointestinal (11\%), general (10\%), dermatological (8\%), hepatic (8\%), musculoskeletal (6\%), pancreatic (6\%), haematological, metabolic, neurological, cardiac (each 2\%), infective and ocular (each 1\%) events. The highest risk of first-onset csAE was during the first 4 weeks compared with the period from 4 weeks to end of treatment (odds ratio 3.13, 95\% confidence interval 1.95-5.02). The median time to first onset csAE was significantly shorter with combination than monotherapy IO (32 vs. 146 days, P {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In our series of early phase IO trials, the risk of csAE was highest during the initial 4 weeks on IO treatment, supporting the use of the conventional DLT period for dose escalation decision. However, there were 24 clinically significant late-onset DLTs in 5.7\% of patients. Combination IO was associated with greater risk of and also earlier onset for csAE, which may need to be considered for early phase trial design.},

For the first 100 TARGET patients, ctDNA data showed good concordance with matched tumor and results were turned round within a clinically acceptable timeframe for Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) review. When a 2.5\% variant allele frequency (VAF) threshold was applied, actionable mutations were identified in 41 of 100 patients, and 11 of these patients received a matched therapy.

	abstract = {Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 predispose individuals to certain cancers1-3, and disease-specific screening and preventative strategies have reduced cancer mortality in affected patients4,5. These classical tumour-suppressor genes have tumorigenic effects associated with somatic biallelic inactivation, although haploinsufficiency may also promote the formation and progression of tumours6,7. Moreover, BRCA1/2-mutant tumours are often deficient in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks by homologous recombination8-13, and consequently exhibit increased therapeutic sensitivity to platinum-containing therapy and inhibitors of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP)14,15. However, the phenotypic and therapeutic relevance of mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 remains poorly defined in most cancer types. Here we show that in the 2.7\% and 1.8\% of patients with advanced-stage cancer and germline pathogenic or somatic loss-of-function alterations in BRCA1/2, respectively, selective pressure for biallelic inactivation, zygosity-dependent phenotype penetrance, and sensitivity to PARP inhibition were observed only in tumour types associated with increased heritable cancer risk in BRCA1/2 carriers (BRCA-associated cancer types). Conversely, among patients with non-BRCA-associated cancer types, most carriers of these BRCA1/2 mutation types had evidence for tumour pathogenesis that was independent of mutant BRCA1/2. Overall, mutant BRCA is an indispensable founding event for some tumours, but in a considerable proportion of other cancers, it appears to be biologically neutral-a difference predominantly conditioned by tumour lineage-with implications for disease pathogenesis, screening, design of clinical trials and therapeutic decision-making.},

It is increasingly clear that the effectiveness of immunomodulatory strategies depends on the presence of a baseline immune response and on unleashing of pre-existing immunity. Therefore, a general consensus emerged on the central part played by effector T cells in the antitumour responses. Recent technological, analytical and mechanistic advances in immunology have enabled the identification of patients who are more likely to respond to immunotherapy. In this Review, we focus on defining hot, altered and cold tumours, the complexity of the tumour microenvironment, the Immunoscore and immune contexture of tumours, and we describe approaches to treat such tumours with combination immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitors. In the upcoming era of combination immunotherapy, it is becoming critical to understand the mechanisms responsible for hot, altered or cold immune tumours in order to boost a weak antitumour immunity. The impact of combination therapy on the immune response to convert an immune cold into a hot tumour will be discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The combination of pembrolizumab and axitinib showed antitumor activity in a phase 1b trial involving patients with previously untreated advanced renal-cell carcinoma. Whether pembrolizumab plus axitinib would result in better outcomes than sunitinib in such patients was unclear.
METHODS: In an open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 861 patients with previously untreated advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg) intravenously once every 3 weeks plus axitinib (5 mg) orally twice daily (432 patients) or sunitinib (50 mg) orally once daily for the first 4 weeks of each 6-week cycle (429 patients). The primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. The key secondary end point was the objective response rate. All reported results are from the protocol-specified first interim analysis.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 12.8 months, the estimated percentage of patients who were alive at 12 months was 89.9\% in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and 78.3\% in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio for death, 0.53; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.38 to 0.74; P{\textless}0.0001). Median progression-free survival was 15.1 months in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and 11.1 months in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.57 to 0.84; P{\textless}0.001). The objective response rate was 59.3\% (95\% CI, 54.5 to 63.9) in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and 35.7\% (95\% CI, 31.1 to 40.4) in the sunitinib group (P{\textless}0.001). The benefit of pembrolizumab plus axitinib was observed across the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk groups (i.e., favorable, intermediate, and poor risk) and regardless of programmed death ligand 1 expression. Grade 3 or higher adverse events of any cause occurred in 75.8\% of patients in the pembrolizumab-axitinib group and in 70.6\% in the sunitinib group.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with previously untreated advanced renal-cell carcinoma, treatment with pembrolizumab plus axitinib resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival, as well as a higher objective response rate, than treatment with sunitinib.

Cetuximab was administered starting approximately 5 days prior to radiation per standard of care.Results: A total of 16 patients were entered onto the study, with 15 evaluable for acute toxicity. The most common treatment-related grade 3-4 side effects were radiation dermatitis and mucositis (38\% and 69\%, respectively). The MTD was determined to be 50 mg orally twice daily, but the recommended phase II dose was deemed to be 25 mg orally twice daily. At a median follow-up of 26 months, the actuarial median overall survival was 37 months, but was not reached for other endpoints. Two-year overall survival, progression-free survival, local control, and distant control rates were 72\%, 63\%, 72\%, and 79\%, respectively. Patients who continued to smoke during therapy experienced higher recurrence rates. MYC and KMT2A were identified as potential correlatives of response on gene amplification and mutational analysis.Conclusions: Olaparib at 25 mg orally twice daily with concurrent cetuximab and radiation was well tolerated with reduced dermatitis within the radiation field.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: There is a lack of treatments providing survival benefit for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC), with no standard of care. A randomized phase II trial showed significant benefit for gemcitabine, carboplatin, and iniparib (GCI) over gemcitabine and carboplatin (GC) in clinical benefit rate, response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Here, we formally compare the efficacy of these regimens in a phase III trial.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage IV/locally recurrent TNBC who had received no more than two previous chemotherapy regimens for mTNBC were randomly allocated to gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) and carboplatin area under the curve 2 (days 1 and 8) alone or GC plus iniparib 5.6 mg/kg (days 1, 4, 8, and 11) every 3 weeks. Random assignment was stratified by the number of prior chemotherapies. The coprimary end points were OS and PFS. Patients receiving GC could cross over to iniparib on progression.
RESULTS: Five hundred nineteen patients were randomly assigned (261 GCI; 258 GC). In the primary analysis, no statistically significant difference was observed for OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.69 to 1.12; P = .28) nor PFS (HR = 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.65 to 0.98; P = .027). An exploratory analysis showed that patients in the second-/third-line had improved OS (HR = 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.46 to 0.91) and PFS (HR = 0.68; 95\% CI, 0.50 to 0.92) with GCI. The safety profile for GCI was similar to GC.
CONCLUSION: The trial did not meet the prespecified criteria for the coprimary end points of PFS and OS in the ITT population. The potential benefit with iniparib observed in second-/third-line subgroup warrants further evaluation.},

Activating costimulatory pathways to induce stronger T cell activation may improve the efficacy of checkpoint inhibition and lead to durable antitumor responses. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of more than 2000 tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in mice receiving both PD-1 and GITR (glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein) antibodies and found that this combination synergistically enhanced the effector function of expanded CD8+ T cells by restoring the balance of key homeostatic regulators CD226 and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), leading to a robust survival benefit. Combination therapy decreased CD8+ T cell dysfunction and induced a highly proliferative precursor effector memory T cell phenotype in a CD226-dependent manner. PD-1 inhibition rescued CD226 activity by preventing PD-1-Src homology region 2 (SHP2) dephosphophorylation of the CD226 intracellular domain, whereas GITR agonism decreased TIGIT expression. Unmasking the molecular pathways driving durable antitumor responses will be essential to the development of rational approaches to optimizing cancer immunotherapy.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Integration of evolutionary dynamics into systemic therapy for metastatic cancers can prolong tumor control compared with standard maximum tolerated dose (MTD) strategies. Prior investigations have focused on monotherapy, but many clinical cancer treatments combine two or more drugs. Optimizing the evolutionary dynamics in multidrug therapy is challenging because of the complex cellular interactions and the large parameter space of potential variations in drugs, doses, and treatment schedules. However, multidrug therapy also represents an opportunity to further improve outcomes using evolution-based strategies.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examine evolution-based strategies for two-drug therapy and identify an approach that divides the treatment drugs into primary and secondary roles. The primary drug has the greatest efficacy and/or lowest toxicity. The secondary drug is applied solely to reduce the resistant population to the primary drug.
RESULTS: Simulations from the mathematical model demonstrate that the primary-secondary approach increases time to progression (TTP) compared with conventional strategies in which drugs are administered without regard to evolutionary dynamics. We apply our model to an ongoing adaptive therapy clinical trial of evolution-based administration of abiraterone to treat metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Model simulations, parameterized with data from individual patients who progressed, demonstrate that strategic application of docetaxel during abiraterone therapy would have significantly increased their TTP.
CONCLUSIONS: Mathematical models can integrate evolutionary dynamics into multidrug cancer clinical trials. This has the potential to improve outcomes and to develop clinical trials in which these mathematical models are also used to estimate the mechanism(s) of treatment failure and explore alternative strategies to improve outcomes in future trials.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The management of metastatic breast cancer requires monitoring of the tumor burden to determine the response to treatment, and improved biomarkers are needed. Biomarkers such as cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) and circulating tumor cells have been widely studied. However, circulating cell-free DNA carrying tumor-specific alterations (circulating tumor DNA) has not been extensively investigated or compared with other circulating biomarkers in breast cancer.
METHODS: We compared the radiographic imaging of tumors with the assay of circulating tumor DNA, CA 15-3, and circulating tumor cells in 30 women with metastatic breast cancer who were receiving systemic therapy. We used targeted or whole-genome sequencing to identify somatic genomic alterations and designed personalized assays to quantify circulating tumor DNA in serially collected plasma specimens. CA 15-3 levels and numbers of circulating tumor cells were measured at identical time points.
RESULTS: Circulating tumor DNA was successfully detected in 29 of the 30 women (97\%) in whom somatic genomic alterations were identified; CA 15-3 and circulating tumor cells were detected in 21 of 27 women (78\%) and 26 of 30 women (87\%), respectively. Circulating tumor DNA levels showed a greater dynamic range, and greater correlation with changes in tumor burden, than did CA 15-3 or circulating tumor cells. Among the measures tested, circulating tumor DNA provided the earliest measure of treatment response in 10 of 19 women (53\%).
CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept analysis showed that circulating tumor DNA is an informative, inherently specific, and highly sensitive biomarker of metastatic breast cancer. (Funded by Cancer Research UK and others.).},

The idea of viewing cancer from an ecological perspective has many implications but, basically, it means that we should not see cancer just as a group of mutated cells. A more useful definition of cancer is to consider it a disruption in the complex balance of many interacting cellular and microenvironmental elements in a specific organ. This perspective means that organs undergoing carcinogenesis should be seen as sophisticated ecosystems in homoeostasis that cancer cells can disrupt. It also makes cancer seem even more complex but may ultimately provide insights that make it more treatable. Here, we discuss how ecological principles can be used to better understand cancer progression and treatment, using several mathematical and computational models to illustrate our argument.},

	abstract = {A new ecologically inspired paradigm in cancer treatment known as “adaptive therapy” capitalizes on competitive interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subclones. The goal of adaptive therapy is to maintain a controllable stable tumor burden by allowing a significant population of treatment sensitive cells to survive. These, in turn, suppress proliferation of the less fit resistant populations. However, there remain several open challenges in designing adaptive therapies, particularly in extending these therapeutic concepts to multiple treatments. We present a cancer treatment case study (metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer) as a point of departure to illustrate three novel concepts to aid the design of multi-drug adaptive therapies. First, frequency-dependent “cycles” of tumor evolution can trap tumor evolution in a periodic, controllable loop. Second, the availability and selection of treatments may limit the evolutionary “absorbing region” reachable by the tumor. Third, the velocity of evolution significantly influences the optimal timing of drug sequences.},

	abstract = {Signaling networks play key homeostatic processes in living organisms but are commonly hijacked in oncogenesis. Prominent examples include genetically altered receptor tyrosine kinases and dysregulated intracellular signaling molecules. The discovery and development of targeted therapies against such oncogenic proteins has imparted clinical benefit. Nevertheless, concerns remain about the limited single-agent efficacy and narrow therapeutic indices of many of these antitumor agents. Moreover, it is apparent that oncogenic proteins comprise complex signaling networks that interact through crosstalk and feedback loops, which modify therapeutic vulnerability. These complexities mandate the study of drug combinations, which will also become necessary to reverse tumor drug resistance. Here, we outline the challenges associated with rational drug codevelopment strategies, with a focus on the importance of analytically validated biomarkers for patient selection and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) studies. Overall, the most informative clinical studies of novel combinations will have the following characteristics: robust scientific hypotheses leading to their selection; supportive preclinical data from contextually appropriate preclinical model systems; sufficient preclinical PK data to inform on the risk of drug-drug interactions; and detailed PD studies to determine the biologically active dose range for each agent. Toward this end, several novel clinical trial designs may be envisioned to accelerate successful drug combination development while minimizing the risk of late drug combination attrition. Although considerable challenges remain, these efforts may enable important steps to be taken toward more durable therapeutic control of many cancers.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor belinostat has activity in various cancers. Because belinostat is metabolized by the liver, reduced hepatic clearance could lead to excessive drug accumulation and increased toxicity. Safety data in patients with liver dysfunction are needed for this drug to reach its full potential in the clinic.
METHODS: We performed a phase 1 trial to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and pharmacokinetics (PK) of belinostat in patients with advanced cancer and varying degrees of liver dysfunction.
RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were enrolled and divided into cohorts based on liver function. In patients with mild dysfunction, the MTD was the same as the recommended phase 2 dose (1000 mg/m2 /day). Belinostat was well tolerated in patients with moderate and severe liver dysfunction, although the trial was closed before the MTD in these cohorts could be determined. The mean clearance of belinostat was 661 mL/min/m2 in patients with normal liver function, compared to 542, 505, and 444 mL/min/m2 in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic dysfunction. Although this trial was not designed to assess clinical activity, of the 47 patients evaluable for response, thirteen patients (27.7\%) experienced stable disease.
CONCLUSIONS: While a statistically significant difference in clearance indicates increased belinostat exposure with worsening liver function, no relationship was observed between belinostat exposure and toxicity. An assessment of belinostat metabolites revealed significant differences in metabolic pathway capability in patients with differing levels of liver dysfunction. Further studies are needed to establish formal dosing guidelines in this patient population.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are undergoing extensive clinical testing for their single-agent activity in homologous recombination (HR)-deficient tumors and ability to enhance the action of certain DNA-damaging agents. Compared with other PARP inhibitors in development, iniparib (4-iodo-3-nitrobenzamide) is notable for its simple structure and the reported ability of its intracellular metabolite 4-iodo-3-nitrosobenzamide to covalently inhibit PARP1 under cell-free conditions. The present preclinical studies were conducted to compare the actions iniparib with the more extensively characterized PARP inhibitors olaparib and veliparib.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The abilities of iniparib, olaparib, and veliparib to (i) selectively induce apoptosis or inhibit colony formation in HR-deficient cell lines, (ii) selectively sensitize HR-proficient cells to topoisomerase I poisons, and (iii) inhibit formation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymer (pADPr) in intact cells were compared.
RESULTS: Consistent with earlier reports, olaparib and veliparib selectively induced apoptosis and inhibited colony formation in cells lacking BRCA2 or ATM. Moreover, like earlier generation PARP inhibitors, olaparib and veliparib sensitized cells to the topoisomerase I poisons camptothecin and topotecan. Finally, olaparib and veliparib inhibited formation of pADPr in intact cells. In contrast, iniparib exhibited little or no ability to selectively kill HR-deficient cells, sensitize cells to topoisomerase I poisons, or inhibit pADPr formation in situ. In further experiments, iniparib also failed to sensitize cells to cisplatin, gemcitabine, or paclitaxel.
CONCLUSIONS: While iniparib kills normal and neoplastic cells at high ({\textgreater}40 μmol/L) concentrations, its effects are unlikely to reflect PARP inhibition and should not be used to guide decisions about other PARP inhibitors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancers have inherent defects in DNA repair, making this cancer a rational target for therapy based on poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition.
METHODS: We conducted an open-label, phase 2 study to compare the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine and carboplatin with or without iniparib, a small molecule with PARP-inhibitory activity, in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. A total of 123 patients were randomly assigned to receive gemcitabine (1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and carboplatin (at a dose equivalent to an area under the concentration-time curve of 2) on days 1 and 8--with or without iniparib (at a dose of 5.6 mg per kilogram of body weight) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11--every 21 days. Primary end points were the rate of clinical benefit (i.e., the rate of objective response [complete or partial response] plus the rate of stable disease for ≥6 months) and safety. Additional end points included the rate of objective response, progression-free survival, and overall survival.
RESULTS: The addition of iniparib to gemcitabine and carboplatin improved the rate of clinical benefit from 34\% to 56\% (P=0.01) and the rate of overall response from 32\% to 52\% (P=0.02). The addition of iniparib also prolonged the median progression-free survival from 3.6 months to 5.9 months (hazard ratio for progression, 0.59; P=0.01) and the median overall survival from 7.7 months to 12.3 months (hazard ratio for death, 0.57; P=0.01). The most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events in either treatment group included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue or asthenia, leukopenia, and increased alanine aminotransferase level. No significant difference was seen between the two groups in the rate of adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of iniparib to chemotherapy improved the clinical benefit and survival of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer without significantly increased toxic effects. On the basis of these results, a phase 3 trial adequately powered to evaluate overall survival and progression-free survival is being conducted.

Here, we propose a sequence of in vitro assays to improve selection of TCRs and exemplify risk assessments of on-target as well as off-target toxicities using TCRs directed against cancer germline antigens. The proposed panel of assays covers parameters considered key to safety, such as expression of target antigen in healthy tissues, determination of a TCR's recognition motif toward its cognate peptide, and a TCR's cross-reactivity toward noncognate peptides.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Combination treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and antiangiogenic drugs has shown encouraging preliminary antitumor activity across various tumor types including advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). The open-label, parallel-cohort, dose-escalation, phase I CheckMate 016 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in combination with antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors or ipilimumab. Long-term outcomes from this study for the combination of nivolumab plus sunitinib or pazopanib in aRCC are presented.
METHODS: Patients with aRCC received nivolumab plus either sunitinib (50 mg/day, 4 weeks on/2 weeks off; N + S) or pazopanib (800 mg/day; N + P) until progression/unacceptable toxicity. The nivolumab starting dose was 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, with planned escalation to 5 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability; antitumor activity was a secondary endpoint.
RESULTS: Arm N + S enrolled 33 patients, 19 of whom were treatment-naïve; this arm advanced to the expansion phase. Median follow-up was 50.0 months. Patients experienced high frequencies of adverse events (AEs) including treatment-related AEs (100\%), grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs (82\%), and treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation (39\%). Investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) was 55\% (18/33) and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12.7 months. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached. Arm N + P enrolled 20 patients, all had ≥1 prior systemic therapy; this arm was closed due to dose-limiting toxicities and did not proceed to expansion. Median follow-up was 27.1 months. Patients treated with N + P experienced high frequencies of AEs including treatment-related AEs (100\%), grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs (70\%), and treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation (25\%). Investigator-assessed ORR was 45\% (9/20) and median PFS was 7.2 months. Median OS was 27.9 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of standard doses of sunitinib or pazopanib to nivolumab resulted in a high incidence of high-grade toxicities limiting future development of either combination regimen. While there was no adverse impact on response and the OS outcome was notable, the findings suggest that the success of combination regimens based on immune checkpoint inhibitors and antiangiogenic drugs may be dependent on careful selection of the antiangiogenic component and dose.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most patients with locally advanced, unresectable, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have disease progression despite definitive chemoradiotherapy (chemotherapy plus concurrent radiation therapy). This phase 3 study compared the anti-programmed death ligand 1 antibody durvalumab as consolidation therapy with placebo in patients with stage III NSCLC who did not have disease progression after two or more cycles of platinum-based chemoradiotherapy.
METHODS: We randomly assigned patients, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive durvalumab (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously) or placebo every 2 weeks for up to 12 months. The study drug was administered 1 to 42 days after the patients had received chemoradiotherapy. The coprimary end points were progression-free survival (as assessed by means of blinded independent central review) and overall survival (unplanned for the interim analysis). Secondary end points included 12-month and 18-month progression-free survival rates, the objective response rate, the duration of response, the time to death or distant metastasis, and safety.
RESULTS: Of 713 patients who underwent randomization, 709 received consolidation therapy (473 received durvalumab and 236 received placebo). The median progression-free survival from randomization was 16.8 months (95\% confidence interval [CI], 13.0 to 18.1) with durvalumab versus 5.6 months (95\% CI, 4.6 to 7.8) with placebo (stratified hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.52; 95\% CI, 0.42 to 0.65; P{\textless}0.001); the 12-month progression-free survival rate was 55.9\% versus 35.3\%, and the 18-month progression-free survival rate was 44.2\% versus 27.0\%. The response rate was higher with durvalumab than with placebo (28.4\% vs. 16.0\%; P{\textless}0.001), and the median duration of response was longer (72.8\% vs. 46.8\% of the patients had an ongoing response at 18 months). The median time to death or distant metastasis was longer with durvalumab than with placebo (23.2 months vs. 14.6 months; P{\textless}0.001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 29.9\% of the patients who received durvalumab and 26.1\% of those who received placebo; the most common adverse event of grade 3 or 4 was pneumonia (4.4\% and 3.8\%, respectively). A total of 15.4\% of patients in the durvalumab group and 9.8\% of those in the placebo group discontinued the study drug because of adverse events.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fusions involving one of three tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK) occur in diverse cancers in children and adults. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib, a highly selective TRK inhibitor, in adults and children who had tumors with these fusions.
METHODS: We enrolled patients with consecutively and prospectively identified TRK fusion-positive cancers, detected by molecular profiling as routinely performed at each site, into one of three protocols: a phase 1 study involving adults, a phase 1-2 study involving children, or a phase 2 study involving adolescents and adults. The primary end point for the combined analysis was the overall response rate according to independent review. Secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety.
RESULTS: A total of 55 patients, ranging in age from 4 months to 76 years, were enrolled and treated. Patients had 17 unique TRK fusion-positive tumor types. The overall response rate was 75\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 61 to 85) according to independent review and 80\% (95\% CI, 67 to 90) according to investigator assessment. At 1 year, 71\% of the responses were ongoing and 55\% of the patients remained progression-free. The median duration of response and progression-free survival had not been reached. At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, 86\% of the patients with a response (38 of 44 patients) were continuing treatment or had undergone surgery that was intended to be curative. Adverse events were predominantly of grade 1, and no adverse event of grade 3 or 4 that was considered by the investigators to be related to larotrectinib occurred in more than 5\% of patients. No patient discontinued larotrectinib owing to drug-related adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Larotrectinib had marked and durable antitumor activity in patients with TRK fusion-positive cancer, regardless of the age of the patient or of the tumor type. (Funded by Loxo Oncology and others; ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT02122913 , NCT02637687 , and NCT02576431 .).},

METHODS: PubMed search was conducted for articles published until December of 2016. Trials needed to have at least one of the study arms consisting of nivolumab, pembrolizumab or atezolizumab monotherapy. Trials were matched based on compound used and similarity of populations. All toxicities were reported as frequencies and percentages. P-values to assess differences between matches and non-matches of phase 1 and late-phase trials and between early and late-phase trials themselves were obtained via Fisher's exact test. Odds ratios were obtained via logistic regression.
RESULTS: Our search yielded 15 late-phase and 10 matching phase 1 trials; n = 4823 and n = 1650, respectively. The most common AEs seen in phase 1 trials were also observed in late-phase trials except for phase 1 trials (median n = 118) with {\textless} 118 patients (P = 0.048). Rash, pruritus, and diarrhea were the most frequently irAEs reported. Only colitis was more frequent in late-phase studies (P = 0.045).
CONCLUSION: Toxicities of anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 observed in phase 1 trials and late-phase trials are similar. There is positive correlation between phase 1 trial sample size and concordance of toxicity frequencies seen in late-phase studies. In conclusion, current immunotherapy phase 1 trials are appropriate in assessing safety profile of anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We conducted a comprehensive review of the design, implementation, and outcome of first-in-human (FIH) trials of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to clearly determine early clinical development strategies for this class of compounds.
METHODS: We performed a PubMed search using appropriate terms to identify reports of FIH trials of mAbs published in peer-reviewed journals between January 2000 and April 2013.
RESULTS: A total of 82 publications describing FIH trials were selected for analysis. Only 27 articles (33\%) reported the criteria used for selecting the starting dose (SD). Dose escalation was performed using rule-based methods in 66 trials (80\%). The median number of planned dose levels was five (range, two to 13). The median of the ratio between the highest planned dose and the SD was 27 (range, two to 3,333). Although in 56 studies (68\%) at least one grade 3 or 4 toxicity event was reported, no dose-limiting toxicity was observed in 47 trials (57\%). The highest planned dose was reached in all trials, but the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was defined in only 13 studies (16\%). The median of the ratio between MTD and SD was eight (range, four to 1,000). The recommended phase II dose was indicated in 34 studies (41\%), but in 25 (73\%) of these trials, this dose was chosen without considering toxicity as the main selection criterion.
CONCLUSION: This literature review highlights the broad design heterogeneity of FIH trials testing mAbs. Because of the limited observed toxicity, the MTD was infrequently reached, and therefore, the recommended phase II dose for subsequent clinical trials was only tentatively defined.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Recent studies have identified mutation signatures of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) in over 20\% of breast cancers, as well as pancreatic, ovarian, and gastric cancers. There is an urgent need to understand the clinical implications of HRD signatures. Whereas BRCA1/2 mutations confer sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapies, it is not yet clear whether mutation signatures can independently predict platinum response.Experimental Design: In this observational study, we sequenced tumor whole genomes (100× depth) and matched normals (60×) of 93 advanced-stage breast cancers (33 platinum-treated). We computed a published metric called HRDetect, independently trained to predict BRCA1/2 status, and assessed its capacity to predict outcomes on platinum-based chemotherapies. Clinical endpoints were overall survival (OS), total duration on platinum-based therapy (TDT), and radiographic evidence of clinical improvement (CI).Results: HRDetect predicted BRCA1/2 status with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 and optimal threshold of 0.7. Elevated HRDetect was also significantly associated with CI on platinum-based therapy (AUC = 0.89; P = 0.006) with the same optimal threshold, even after adjusting for BRCA1/2 mutation status and treatment timing. HRDetect scores over 0.7 were associated with a 3-month extended median TDT (P = 0.0003) and 1.3-year extended median OS (P = 0.04).Conclusions: Our findings not only independently validate HRDetect, but also provide the first evidence of its association with platinum response in advanced breast cancer. We demonstrate that HRD mutation signatures may offer clinically relevant information independently of BRCA1/2 mutation status and hope this work will guide the development of clinical trials.

We reviewed the reported incidence of toxicity in phase III trials at doses and schedules recommended by phase I trials to evaluate whether these recommendations are realistic when drugs are used in larger populations of patients. We systematically reviewed a safety profile of small molecule (SM-MTA) and mAb MTA (MA-MTA) approved by the FDA in the last 12 years. There was a significantly increased percentage of grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported with SM-MTA compared with MA-MTA [40\% vs. 27\%; RR 1.5; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.10-2.25, P = 0.038] in phase III studies. Importantly, a substantial proportion of patients (45\%) treated with SM-MTA required dose modifications due to drug-related toxicity in phase III trials. However, this toxicity was associated to a definitive study drug discontinuation in only 9\%. Overall, 25\% of SM-MTA declared recommended phase II doses below MTD based on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic data and these trials were associated with a significantly reduced number of dose modifications in registration trials (32\% vs. 50\%; RR 0.64; 95\% CI, 0.43-0.88, P = 0.01). Tolerability is going to come into further focus due to the need for combinations of SM-MTA and other anticancer agents. There was a higher incidence of grade 3-4 toxicity in phase III trials in combinations versus single-agent SM-MTAs (64\% vs. 37\%; RR 1.73; 95\% CI, 1.3-2.3, P = 0.001).

RESULTS: Integrative genomic analysis indicated overexpression of the AP-1 transcriptional complex suggesting experimental therapeutic rationales, including blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. This led to the repurposing of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist, irbesartan, as an anticancer therapy, resulting in the patient experiencing a dramatic and durable response.

	doi = {10.1186/s13063-019-3206-x},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In proportionate or adaptive interventions, the dose or intensity can be adjusted based on individual need at predefined decision stages during the delivery of the intervention. The development of such interventions may require an evaluation of the effectiveness of the individual stages in addition to the whole intervention. However, evaluating individual stages of an intervention has various challenges, particularly the statistical design and analysis. This review aimed to identify the use of trials of proportionate interventions and how they are being designed and analysed in current practice.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science and PsycINFO for articles published between 2010 and 2015 inclusive. We considered trials of proportionate interventions in all fields of research. For each trial, its aims, design and analysis were extracted. The data synthesis was conducted using summary statistics and a narrative format.
RESULTS: Our review identified 44 proportionate intervention trials, comprising 28 trial results, 13 protocols and three secondary analyses. These were mostly described as stepped care (n=37) and mainly focussed on mental health research (n=30). The other studies were aimed at finding an optimal adaptive treatment strategy (n=7) in a variety of therapeutic areas. Further terminology used included adaptive intervention, staged intervention, sequentially multiple assignment trial or a two-phase design. The median number of decision stages in the interventions was two and only one study explicitly evaluated the effect of the individual stages.
CONCLUSIONS: Trials of proportionate staged interventions are being used predominantly within the mental health field. However, few studies consider the different stages of the interventions, either at the design or the analysis phase, and how they may interact with one another. There is a need for further guidance on the design, analyses and reporting across trials of proportionate interventions.

Despite only being published in 2015, the design has been implemented in at least two oncology trials. However, these trials require patients to have completed follow-up before clinicians can make dose escalation decisions. For trials of radiotherapy or advanced therapeutics, this may lead to impractically long trial durations due to late-onset treatment-related toxicities. We extend the product of independent probabilities escalation design to use censored time-to-event toxicity outcomes for making dose escalation decisions. We show via comprehensive simulation studies and sensitivity analyses that trial duration can be reduced by up to 35\%, particularly when recruitment is faster than expected, without compromising on other operating characteristics.},

	abstract = {Recent trials of adoptive cell therapy (ACT), such as the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, have demonstrated promising therapeutic effects for cancer patients. A main issue in the product development is to determine the appropriate dose of ACT. Traditional phase I trial designs for cytotoxic agents explicitly assume that toxicity increases monotonically with dose levels and implicitly assume the same for efficacy to justify dose escalation. ACT usually induces rapid responses, and the monotonic dose-response assumption is unlikely to hold due to its immunobiologic activities. We propose a toxicity and efficacy probability interval (TEPI) design for dose finding in ACT trials. This approach incorporates efficacy outcomes to inform dosing decisions to optimize efficacy and safety simultaneously. Rather than finding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the TEPI design is aimed at finding the dose with the most desirable outcome for safety and efficacy. The key features of TEPI are its simplicity, flexibility, and transparency, because all decision rules can be prespecified prior to trial initiation. We conduct simulation studies to investigate the operating characteristics of the TEPI design and compare it to existing methods. In summary, the TEPI design is a novel method for ACT dose finding, which possesses superior performance and is easy to use, simple, and transparent. Clin Cancer Res; 23(1); 13-20. ©2016 AACR.},

We show, both theoretically and numerically, that the BOIN design not only has superior finite and large sample properties but also can be easily implemented in a simple way similar to the traditional ‘3+3’ design. Compared with the well-known continual reassessment method, the BOIN design yields comparable average performance to select the maximum tolerated dose but has a substantially lower risk of assigning patients to subtherapeutic and overly toxic doses.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Reports of 81 first-in-human phase I trials evaluating 60 different molecularly targeted agents administered as monotherapy were reviewed. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the highest safe dose administered to patients, whereas the maximum-administered dose (MAD) was recorded if the MTD was not reached.
RESULTS: Fifty-seven of the 81 trials specified the animal model used to determine the starting dose, with 29 (51\%) of 57 based on rodent data and 28 (49\%) of 57 based on non-rodent data. A wide range of toxicologic parameters was used to select the starting dose. The starting dose exceeded the human MTD in three (3.7\%) of 81 trials, and in all three trials, nonhematologic toxicity was dose limiting. The median number of dose levels to reach MTD or MAD from starting dose was five (range, one to 14 dose levels), and the median ratio of MTD or MAD to starting dose was 12 (range, {\textless} 1 to 300). Hypothetical doubling of the starting dose appeared to be safe, whereas tripling of the starting dose was unsafe.
CONCLUSION: The derivation of starting dose for first-in-human phase I trials of molecularly targeted agents in patients with cancer is safe but is based on diverse practices using a variety of preclinical toxicologic parameters.},

	abstract = {In the modern era of cancer treatment, with targeted agents superseding more traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, it is becoming increasingly important to use stratified medicine approaches to ensure that patients receive the most appropriate drugs and treatment schedules. In this context, there is significant potential for the use of pharmacodynamic biomarkers to provide pharmacological information, which could be used in a therapeutic drug monitoring setting. This review focuses on discussing some of the challenges faced to date in translating preclinical pharmacodynamic biomarker approaches to a clinical setting. Recent advances in important areas including circulating biomarkers and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling approaches are discussed, and selected examples of anticancer drugs where there is existing evidence to potentially advance pharmacodynamic therapeutic drug monitoring approaches to deliver more effective treatment are discussed. Although we may not yet be in a position to systematically implement therapeutic drug monitoring approaches based on pharmacodynamic information in a cancer patient setting, such approaches are likely to become more commonplace in the coming years. Based on ever-increasing levels of pharmacodynamic information being generated on newer anticancer drugs, facilitated by increasingly advanced and accessible experimental approaches available to researchers to collect these data, we can now look forward optimistically to significant advances being made in this area.},

However, the additional modulation of immune response by ICBs may rarely cause immune-related infectious complications, including re-activation of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBC) with detrimental effects on those patients’ outcome. Here, we present two “real-world” melanoma cases that were treated in our department with blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 and developed active Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) during immunotherapy. In view of these cases, we review the literature for ICB-associated MTB reactivation and discuss our considerations about the possible interactions of immunotherapy and the underlying co-existent mycobacterial infection. Based on the current evidence from preclinical findings prior to this experience, we raise questions regarding cancer patients who are at higher risk for developing MTB infection, whether ICB-treated patients should be considered immunocompromised, and how they should be managed for latent and/or active tuberculosis. Aside from the well-established clinical benefit of immunotherapy, the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 axis may concurrently disrupt the immune control of specific opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis that should be carefully and expectantly managed in order to avoid compromising the outcome of cancer treatment and the affected patient’s survival.},

However, the statistical community agrees on the limitations of the 3 + 3 design compared with model-based approaches. Moreover, the mechanisms of action of targeted agents strongly challenge the hypothesis that the maximum tolerated dose constitutes the optimal dose, and more outcomes including clinical and biological activity increasingly need to be taken into account to identify the optimal dose.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We review key elements from clinical publications and from the statistical literature to show that the 3 + 3 design lacks the necessary flexibility to address the challenges of targeted agents.
RESULTS: The design issues raised by expansion cohorts, new definitions of dose-limiting toxicity and trials of combinations are not easily addressed by the 3 + 3 design or its extensions.
CONCLUSIONS: Alternative statistical proposals have been developed to make a better use of the complex data generated by phase I trials. Their applications require a close collaboration between all actors of early phase clinical trials.},

The main goal of these studies is to establish the recommended dose and/or schedule of new drugs or drug combinations for phase II trials. The guiding principle for dose escalation in phase I trials is to avoid exposing too many patients to subtherapeutic doses while preserving safety and maintaining rapid accrual. Here we review dose escalation methods for phase I trials, including the rule-based and model-based dose escalation methods that have been developed to evaluate new anticancer agents. Toxicity has traditionally been the primary endpoint for phase I trials involving cytotoxic agents. However, with the emergence of molecularly targeted anticancer agents, potential alternative endpoints to delineate optimal biological activity, such as plasma drug concentration and target inhibition in tumor or surrogate tissues, have been proposed along with new trial designs. We also describe specific methods for drug combinations as well as methods that use a time-to-event endpoint or both toxicity and efficacy as endpoints. Finally, we present the advantages and drawbacks of the various dose escalation methods and discuss specific applications of the methods in developmental oncotherapeutics.},

We also compare their average behavior by computer simulation under each of several hypothetical dose-toxicity curves.

The basic idea and motivation behind the approach stem from an attempt to reconcile the needs of dose-finding experimentation with the ethical demands of established medical practice. It is argued that for these trials the particular shape of the dose toxicity curve is of little interest. Attention focuses rather on identifying a dose with a given targeted toxicity level and on concentrating experimentation at that which all current available evidence indicates to be the best estimate of this level. Such an approach not only makes an explicit attempt to meet ethical requirements but also enables the use of models whose only requirements are that locally (i.e., around the dose corresponding to the targeted toxicity level) they reasonably well approximate the true probability of toxic response. Although a large number of models could be contemplated, we look at a particularly simple one. Extensive simulations show the model to have real promise.},

We describe the clinical setting, practical implications, and safety of such applications, with the aim of understanding how these designs work in practice.
METHODS: We identified 53 phase I trials published between January 2003 and September 2013 that used the continual reassessment method (CRM), CRM using escalation with overdose control, or time-to-event CRM for late-onset toxicities. Study characteristics, design parameters, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) definition, DLT rate, patient-dose allocation, overdose, underdose, sample size, and trial duration were abstracted from each study. In addition, we examined all studies in terms of safety, and we outlined the reasons why escalations occur and under what circumstances.
RESULTS: On average, trials accrued 25 to 35 patients over a 2-year period and tested five dose levels. The average DLT rate was 18\%, which is lower than in previous reports, whereas all levels above the MTD had an average DLT rate of 36\%. On average, 39\% of patients were treated at the MTD, and 74\% were treated at either the MTD or an adjacent level (one level above or below).
CONCLUSION: This review of completed phase I studies confirms the safety and generalizability of model-guided, adaptive dose-escalation designs, and it provides an approach for using, interpreting, and understanding such designs to guide dose escalation in phase I trials.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: A patient-specific dose-escalation scheme using a Bayesian model of Escalation with Overdose Control (EWOC) was conducted to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PNU-214936 in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PNU-214936 is a murine Fab fragment of the monoclonal antibody 5T4 fused to a mutated superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with NSCLC were treated with an individualized dose of PNU-214936 calculated using EWOC, based on their anti-SEA antibody level, and given as a 3-hour infusion on 4 consecutive days.
RESULTS: Fever (82\%; grade 3 to 4, 2.6\%) and hypotension (57\%; grade 3 to 4, 9\%) were the most common toxicities. Eight dose-limiting toxicities occurred, as defined as any grade 4 toxicity occurring within the first 5 days. The MTD was defined as a function of pretreatment anti-SEA antibody level. MTD ranged from 103 ng/kg for patients with anti-SEA concentrations {\textless} or = 10 pmol/mL, to 601 ng/kg for patients with anti-SEA concentrations of 91 to 150 pmol/mL. A minor tumor response was demonstrated in five of 66 assessable patients.
CONCLUSION: EWOC determined phase I doses of PNU-214936 that were adjusted for patient anti-SEA antibody level, while safeguarding against overdose. Furthermore, the method permitted the construction of a dosing algorithm that would allow patients in subsequent clinical investigations to be treated with a dose of PNU-214936 that is tailored to their specific tolerance for the agent, as reflected by their pretreatment anti-SEA.},

We compared data from phase I and registration trials to determine whether early trials predicted later safety and final dose. We searched the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website for drugs approved in nonpediatric cancers (January 1990-October 2012). The recommended phase II dose (R2PD) and toxicities from phase I were compared with doses and safety in later trials. In 62 of 85 (73\%) matched trials, the dose from the later trial was within 20\% of the RP2D. In a multivariable analysis, phase I trials of targeted agents were less predictive of the final approved dose (OR, 0.2 for adopting ± 20\% of the RP2D for targeted vs. other classes; P = 0.025). Of the 530 clinically relevant toxicities in later trials, 70\% (n = 374) were described in phase I. A significant relationship (P = 0.0032) between increasing the number of patients in phase I (up to 60) and the ability to describe future clinically relevant toxicities was observed. Among 28,505 patients in later trials, the death rate that was related to drug was 1.41\%. In conclusion, dosing based on phase I trials was associated with a low toxicity-related death rate in later trials. The ability to predict relevant toxicities correlates with the number of patients on the initial phase I trial. The final dose approved was within 20\% of the RP2D in 73\% of assessed trials.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to understand the relative contributions of inhibiting MEK and AKT on cell growth to guide combinations of these agents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A panel of 20 cell lines was exposed to either the MEK inhibitor, PD0325901, or AKT inhibitor, AKT 1/2 inhibitor. p-ERK and p-S6 ELISAs were used to define degrees of MEK and AKT inhibition, respectively. Growth inhibition to different degrees of MEK and AKT inhibition, either singly or in combination using 96-h sulphorhodamine assays was then studied.
RESULTS: A significantly greater growth inhibition was seen in BRAF(M) and PIK3CA(M) cells upon maximal MEK (P = 0.004) and AKT inhibition (P = 0.038), respectively. KRAS(M) and BRAF/PIK3CA/KRAS(WT) cells were not significantly more likely to be sensitive to MEK or AKT inhibition. Significant incremental growth inhibition of the combination of MEK + AKT over either MEK or AKT inhibition alone was seen when MEK + AKT was inhibited maximally and not when sub-maximal inhibition of both MEK + AKT was used (11/20 cell lines versus 1/20 cell lines; P = 0.0012).
CONCLUSIONS: KRAS(M) cells are likely to benefit from combinations of MEK and AKT inhibitors. Sub-maximally inhibiting both MEK and AKT within a combination, in a majority of instances, does not significantly increase growth inhibition compared with maximally inhibiting MEK or AKT alone and alternative phase I trial designs are needed to clinically evaluate such combinations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Combining targeted and cytotoxic agents has the potential to improve efficacy and attenuate resistance for metastatic cancer. Information regarding safe starting doses for clinical trials of novel three-drug combinations is lacking.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published phase I-III adult oncology clinical trials of three-drug combinations involving a targeted agent were identified by PubMed search (January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2013). A dose percentage was calculated to compare the dose used in combination to the single agent recommended dose: (U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved/recommended phase II dose/maximum tolerated dose). The additive dose percentage was the sum of the dose percentages for each drug in the combination.
RESULTS: A total of 37,763 subjects and 243 drug combinations were included. Only 28\% of studies could give each of the three agents at 100\%. For combinations involving two targeted agents and a cytotoxic agent, the lowest starting additive dose percentage was 133\%, which increased to 250\% if two antibodies were included. For combinations of one targeted agent and two cytotoxic agents, the lowest additive safe dose percentage was 137\%. When both cytotoxic agents were held at 100\%, as occurred in 56\% of studies (which generally used cytotoxic doublets with known combination safety dosing), the lowest safe dose percentage was 225\% (providing that a histone deacetylase inhibitor was not the targeted agent).
CONCLUSION: These findings serve as a safe starting point for dosing novel three-drug combinations involving a targeted agent in clinical trials and practice.

                     2017;22:576-584 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Targeted and cytotoxic drug combinations can improve efficacy and overcome resistance. More knowledge of safe starting doses would facilitate use of combinations in clinical trials and practice. Analysis of 37,763 subjects (243 combinations) showed three drugs could be safely administered, but less than 30\% of combinations could include all three drugs at full dose. Dose reductions to 45\% of the dose of each single agent may be required. Combinations involving two antibodies required fewer dose reductions, and the use of established cytotoxic doublets made initial dose assignment easier.},

Current and emerging biomarkers also reflect the genomic complexity of CRC, and include a wide range of aberrations such as point mutations, amplifications, fusions and hypermutator phenotypes, in addition to global gene expression subtypes. In this Review, we provide an overview of current and emerging clinically relevant biomarkers and their role in the management of patients with CRC, illustrating the intricacies of biomarker interactions and the growing treatment opportunities created by the availability of comprehensive molecular profiling.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Programmed death 1 (PD-1) protein, a T-cell coinhibitory receptor, and one of its ligands, PD-L1, play a pivotal role in the ability of tumor cells to evade the host's immune system. Blockade of interactions between PD-1 and PD-L1 enhances immune function in vitro and mediates antitumor activity in preclinical models.
METHODS: In this multicenter phase 1 trial, we administered intravenous anti-PD-L1 antibody (at escalating doses ranging from 0.3 to 10 mg per kilogram of body weight) to patients with selected advanced cancers. Anti-PD-L1 antibody was administered every 14 days in 6-week cycles for up to 16 cycles or until the patient had a complete response or confirmed disease progression.
RESULTS: As of February 24, 2012, a total of 207 patients--75 with non-small-cell lung cancer, 55 with melanoma, 18 with colorectal cancer, 17 with renal-cell cancer, 17 with ovarian cancer, 14 with pancreatic cancer, 7 with gastric cancer, and 4 with breast cancer--had received anti-PD-L1 antibody. The median duration of therapy was 12 weeks (range, 2 to 111). Grade 3 or 4 toxic effects that investigators considered to be related to treatment occurred in 9\% of patients. Among patients with a response that could be evaluated, an objective response (a complete or partial response) was observed in 9 of 52 patients with melanoma, 2 of 17 with renal-cell cancer, 5 of 49 with non-small-cell lung cancer, and 1 of 17 with ovarian cancer. Responses lasted for 1 year or more in 8 of 16 patients with at least 1 year of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Antibody-mediated blockade of PD-L1 induced durable tumor regression (objective response rate of 6 to 17\%) and prolonged stabilization of disease (rates of 12 to 41\% at 24 weeks) in patients with advanced cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, and renal-cell cancer.

Within 90 minutes after receiving a single intravenous dose of the drug, all six volunteers had a systemic inflammatory response characterized by a rapid induction of proinflammatory cytokines and accompanied by headache, myalgias, nausea, diarrhea, erythema, vasodilatation, and hypotension. Within 12 to 16 hours after infusion, they became critically ill, with pulmonary infiltrates and lung injury, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Severe and unexpected depletion of lymphocytes and monocytes occurred within 24 hours after infusion. All six patients were transferred to the care of the authors at an intensive care unit at a public hospital, where they received intensive cardiopulmonary support (including dialysis), high-dose methylprednisolone, and an anti-interleukin-2 receptor antagonist antibody. Prolonged cardiovascular shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome developed in two patients, who required intensive organ support for 8 and 16 days. Despite evidence of the multiple cytokine-release syndrome, all six patients survived. Documentation of the clinical course occurring over the 30 days after infusion offers insight into the systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the absence of contaminating pathogens, endotoxin, or underlying disease.},

To help inform selection of safe starting doses for novel, two-agent, targeted drug combinations, we identified clinical trials in adult oncology patients who received targeted drug doublets (PubMed, January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2013). The dose percentage was calculated for each drug: (safe dose in combination divided by single agent full dose) X 100. Additive dose percentage represented the sum of the dose percentage for each drug. A total of 144 studies (N = 8568 patients; 95 combinations) were analyzed. In 51\% of trials, each of the two drugs could be administered at 100\% of their full dose. The lowest safe additive dose percentage was 60\% if targets and/or class of drugs overlapped, or in the presence of mTor inhibitors, which sometimes compromised the combination dose. If neither class nor target overlapped and if mTor inhibitors were absent, the lowest safe additive dose percentage was 143\%. The current observations contribute to the knowledge base that informs safe starting doses for new combinations of targeted drugs in the context of clinical trials or practice, hence facilitating customized combination therapies.},

	abstract = {Immunotherapy combinations are used to improve outcomes in metastatic cancer, but evidence-based knowledge of appropriate starting doses for novel combinations is lacking. Phase I-III adult combination clinical trials (≥ 1 drug was immunotherapy; anti-PD-1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4) were reviewed (PubMed Jan 1, 2010 to Sep 1, 2016; ASCO 2014-2016, ASH/ESMO 2014-2015 abstracts). The safe dose for each drug used in each combination was divided by the single-agent recommended dose to calculate dose percentage. Additive dose percentage was the sum of each dose percentage. Overall, 84 studies (N = 3,526 patients, 59 combinations) were analyzed. In 50\% of studies, all drugs could be administered at full dose; 63\%, in the presence of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and 36\% with anti-CTLA-4. The lowest safe starting dose for a doublet combination including a second immunotherapy was 50\% of each drug; 60\%, for a targeted agent. Most doublet/triplets combining anti-PD-1/PD-L1 with cytotoxics were tolerable at full doses. Response rates (median [interquartile range]) were higher for 3-drug than 2-drug combinations (53\% [33-63\%] (N = 23 studies) vs. 23\% [14-39\%]) (N = 60 studies) (p {\textless} 0.0001) with similar rates seen for targeted, cytotoxic, biologic, or additional immunotherapy combinations (p = 0.35). In conclusion, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors can be safely given with a variety of other immunotherapy and targeted agents, albeit at about half dose. Doublet and triplet combinations with cytotoxics could mostly be given at full doses. Anti-CTLA-4 agents compromised dosing more than anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents.

              Background
              Chemotherapy-induced damage of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) causes multi-lineage myelosuppression. Trilaciclib is an intravenous CDK4/6 inhibitor in development to proactively preserve HSPC and immune system function during chemotherapy (myelopreservation). Preclinically, trilaciclib transiently maintains HSPC in G1 arrest and protects them from chemotherapy damage, leading to faster hematopoietic recovery and enhanced anti-tumor immunity.
            
            
              Patients and methods
              This was a Phase 1b (open-label, dose-finding) and Phase 2 (randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled) study of the safety, efficacy and PK of trilaciclib in combination with etoposide/carboplatin (E/P) therapy for treatment-naive extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. Patients received trilaciclib or placebo prior to E/P on days 1-3 of each cycle. Select endpoints were prespecified to assess the effect of trilaciclib on myelosuppression and anti-tumor efficacy.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 122 patients were enrolled, with 19 patients in Part 1 and 75 patients in Part 2 receiving study drug. Improvements were seen with trilaciclib in neutrophil, RBC and lymphocyte measures. Safety on trilaciclib + E/P was improved with fewer ≥ G3 adverse events (AEs) in trilaciclib (50\%) vs. placebo (83.8\%), primarily due to less hematological toxicity. No trilaciclib-related ≥ G3 AEs occurred. Anti-tumor efficacy assessment for trilaciclib vs. placebo, respectively, showed: ORR (66.7\% vs. 56.8\%, p = 0.3831); median PFS (6.2m vs. 5.0m; HR 0.71; p = 0.1695); and OS (10.9m vs. 10.6m; HR 0.87; 0.6107).
            
            
              Conclusion
              Trilaciclib demonstrated an improvement in the patient’s tolerability of chemotherapy as shown by myelopreservation across multiple hematopoietic lineages resulting in fewer supportive care interventions and dose reductions, improved safety profile, and no detriment to anti-tumor efficacy. These data demonstrate strong proof-of-concept for trilaciclib’s myelopreservation benefits.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This phase I, open-label study (Study 1, D3610C00001; NCT01226316) was the first-in-human evaluation of oral AZD5363, a selective pan-AKT inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid malignancies. The objectives were to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of AZD5363, define a recommended dosing schedule, and evaluate preliminary clinical activity.Experimental Design: Patients were aged ≥18 years with World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0 to 1. Dose escalation was conducted within separate continuous and intermittent [4 days/week (4/7) or 2 days/week (2/7)] schedules with safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic analyses. Expansion cohorts of approximately 20 patients each explored AZD5363 activity in PIK3CA-mutant breast and gynecologic cancers.Results: MTDs were 320, 480, and 640 mg for continuous (n = 47), 4/7 (n = 21), and 2/7 (n = 22) schedules, respectively. Dose-limiting toxicities were rash and diarrhea for continuous, hyperglycemia for 2/7, and none for 4/7. Common adverse events were diarrhea (78\%) and nausea (49\%) and, for Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade ≥3 events, hyperglycemia (20\%). The recommended phase II dose (480 mg bid, 4/7 intermittent) was assessed in PIK3CA-mutant breast and gynecologic expansion cohorts: 46\% and 56\% of patients, respectively, showed a reduction in tumor size, with RECIST responses of 4\% and 8\%. These responses were less than the prespecified 20\% response rate; therefore, the criteria to stop further recruitment to the PIK3CA-mutant cohort were met.Conclusions: At the recommended phase II dose, AZD5363 was well tolerated and achieved plasma levels and robust target modulation in tumors. Proof-of-concept responses were observed in patients with PIK3CA-mutant cancers treated with AZD5363. Clin Cancer Res; 24(9); 2050-9. ©2017 AACRSee related commentary by Costa and Bosch, p. 2029.},

	doi = {10.1093/annonc/mdv550},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immunostimulatory monoclonal antibodies (imAbs) targeting immune checkpoint molecules are revolutionizing oncology not only regarding cancer therapeutics and clinical care, but also from a drug development point of view. A handful of first-generation molecules have been approved so far based on their tremendous efficacy, after an expedited development phase that has challenged most paradigms established in the era of conventional cytotoxic therapy and to some extent molecularly targeted agents. A huge wave of second-generation imAbs is just entering into phase 1 trials now, in monotherapy or in combination. In order to maximize their chances of success in early phase trials, and eventually for patients' benefit, their clinical development has to benefit from lessons learnt from previous imAbs phase 1 trials.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the early clinical development of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 and anti-programmed death-1 receptor/ligand. Particularities of each agent, including safety, dose--toxicity and dose--efficacy relationships, scheduling, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), trial design, biomarkers, response assessment and overall drug development strategies, are described and challenged.
RESULTS: As opposed to conventional cytotoxic agents, dose of imAbs is not linearly associated with efficacy and toxicity. Therefore, the definition of a minimal immunologically active dose could be proposed. Traditional patient eligibility criteria might also be revisited as the toxicity profile and mechanism of toxicity--immune-related adverse events--are mostly known and their physiopathology somehow less unexpected than with molecularly targeted small molecules. Most challenging are the comprehensive investigation of complex PK and PD characteristics as well as the definition of patient selection biomarkers. Finally, the early focus on efficacy (and not only dose confirmation) in expansion cohorts challenges the traditional phase 1/2/3 drug development process.
CONCLUSION: Several drug development paradigms have been challenged by imAbs. Here, we discuss novel approaches for an efficient and successful drug development of these agents.},

The questions asked in the PhAT should be viewed as a continuum and not used in isolation. Different drug development programmes derive different types of benefit from these questions. The PhAT is critical in making go-no-go decisions in the development of currently studied drugs and will continue to be relevant to discovery and development of future generations of anticancer agents.},

	abstract = {Dose-finding in cancer clinical trials has been dominated by algorithmic designs on the principle that the highest tolerable dose is also the most effective dose. This assumption no longer applies to the biologic treatments that are characterized by different toxicity and/or efficacy profiles to the extent that the best therapeutic dose might be well below any dose that produces serious toxicity. As such, we propose a two-stage design with focus on immunotherapy trials, incorporating both safety and efficacy information. The 1st stage establishes the safety profile of each dose, with escalation decisions based on likelihood principles. Continuous immunologic outcomes are used to evaluate the relative efficacy of the doses. The 2nd stage employs an adaptive randomization to assign patients to doses showing higher efficacy. Safety is being continuously monitored throughout stage 2, where some doses may be 'closed' due to unacceptable toxicity. The proposed design is compared to the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design using percent dose allocation and estimation of outcomes under different scenarios. We show that by using an efficacy-driven adaptive randomization with safety constraints, the allocation distribution is skewed towards more efficacious doses, and thus limit the number of patients exposed to toxic or non-therapeutic doses.},

	abstract = {Cardiac toxicity after conventional antineoplastic drugs (eg, anthracyclines) has historically been a relevant issue. In addition, targeted therapies and biological molecules can also induce cardiotoxicity. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a novel class of anticancer drugs, distinct from targeted or tumour type-specific therapies. Cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockers (ie, monoclonal antibodies targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1)) has revolutionised the management of a wide variety of malignancies endowed with poor prognosis. These inhibitors unleash antitumour immunity, mediate cancer regression and improve the survival in a percentage of patients with different types of malignancies, but can also produce a wide spectrum of immune-related adverse events. Interestingly, PD-1 and PD-L1 are expressed in rodent and human cardiomyocytes, and early animal studies have demonstrated that CTLA-4 and PD-1 deletion can cause autoimmune myocarditis. Cardiac toxicity has largely been underestimated in recent reviews of toxicity of checkpoint inhibitors, but during the last years several cases of myocarditis and fatal heart failure have been reported in patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors alone and in combination. Here we describe the mechanisms of the most prominent checkpoint inhibitors, specifically ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4, the godfather of checkpoint inhibitors) patient and monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1 (eg, nivolumab, pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 (eg, atezolizumab). We also discuss what is known and what needs to be done about cardiotoxicity of checkpoint inhibitors in patients with cancer. Severe cardiovascular effects associated with checkpoint blockade introduce important issues for oncologists, cardiologists and immunologists.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blockade of programmed death 1 (PD-1), an inhibitory receptor expressed by T cells, can overcome immune resistance. We assessed the antitumor activity and safety of BMS-936558, an antibody that specifically blocks PD-1.
METHODS: We enrolled patients with advanced melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, or renal-cell or colorectal cancer to receive anti-PD-1 antibody at a dose of 0.1 to 10.0 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks. Response was assessed after each 8-week treatment cycle. Patients received up to 12 cycles until disease progression or a complete response occurred.
RESULTS: A total of 296 patients received treatment through February 24, 2012. Grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events occurred in 14\% of patients; there were three deaths from pulmonary toxicity. No maximum tolerated dose was defined. Adverse events consistent with immune-related causes were observed. Among 236 patients in whom response could be evaluated, objective responses (complete or partial responses) were observed in those with non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer. Cumulative response rates (all doses) were 18\% among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (14 of 76 patients), 28\% among patients with melanoma (26 of 94 patients), and 27\% among patients with renal-cell cancer (9 of 33 patients). Responses were durable; 20 of 31 responses lasted 1 year or more in patients with 1 year or more of follow-up. To assess the role of intratumoral PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) expression in the modulation of the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on pretreatment tumor specimens obtained from 42 patients. Of 17 patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, none had an objective response; 9 of 25 patients (36\%) with PD-L1-positive tumors had an objective response (P=0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-PD-1 antibody produced objective responses in approximately one in four to one in five patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer; the adverse-event profile does not appear to preclude its use. Preliminary data suggest a relationship between PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and objective response. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00730639.).},

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In a 3 + 3 dose escalation study, 10 patients received pembrolizumab 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks until progression or intolerable toxicity. Seven additional patients received 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Thirteen patients participated in a 3-week intrapatient dose escalation (dose range, 0.005-10 mg/kg) followed by 2 or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Tumor response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.
RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Maximum administered dose was 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. One patient with melanoma and one with Merkel cell carcinoma experienced complete responses of 57 and 56+ weeks' duration, respectively. Three patients with melanoma experienced partial responses. Fifteen patients with various malignancies experienced stable disease. One patient died of cryptococcal infection 92 days after pembrolizumab discontinuation, following prolonged corticosteroid use for grade 2 gastritis considered drug related. Pembrolizumab exhibited pharmacokinetic characteristics typical of humanized monoclonal antibodies. Maximum serum target engagement was reached with trough levels of doses greater than or equal to 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Mechanism-based translational models with a focus on intratumor exposure prediction suggested robust clinical activity would be observed at doses ≥2 mg/kg every 3 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab was well tolerated and associated with durable antitumor activity in multiple solid tumors. The lowest dose with full potential for antitumor activity was 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Combining several anticancer agents can increase the overall antitumor action, but at the same time, it can also increase the overall observed toxicity. Adaptive dose-escalation designs for drug combinations have recently emerged as an attractive alternative to algorithm-based designs, and they seem more effective in combination recommendations. These methods are not used in practice currently. Our aim is to describe international scientific practices in the setting of phase I drug combinations in oncology.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A bibliometric study on phase I dose-finding combination trials was conducted using the Medline(®) PubMed database between 1 January, 2011, and 31 December 2013. Sorting by abstract, we selected all papers involving a minimum of two agents and then retained only those in which at least two agents were dose-escalated.
RESULTS: Among the 847 references retrieved, 162 papers reported drug-combination phase I trials in which at least two agents were dose-escalated. In 88\% of trials, a traditional or modified 3 + 3 dose-escalation design was used. All except one trial used a design developed for single-agent evaluation. Our study suggests that drug-combination phase I trials in oncology are very safe, as revealed by the calculated median dose-limiting toxicity rate of 6\% at the recommended dose, which is far below the target rate in these trials (33\%). We also examined requirements of phase I clinical trials in oncology with drug combinations and the potential advantages of novel approaches in early phases.
CONCLUSION: Efforts to promote novel and innovative approaches among statisticians and clinicians appear valuable. Adaptive designs have an important role to play in early phase development.},

	abstract = {Background
              Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) induce a range of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) with various degrees of severity. While clinical experience with ICI retreatment following clinically significant irAEs is growing, the safety and efficacy are not yet well characterized.
            
            
              Methods
              This multicenter retrospective study identified patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with ICI who had {\textgreater}1 week therapy interruption for irAEs. Patients were classified into retreatment and discontinuation cohorts based on whether or not they resumed an ICI. Toxicity and clinical outcomes were assessed descriptively.
            
            
              Results
              Of 499 patients treated with ICIs, 80 developed irAEs warranting treatment interruption; 36 (45\%) of whom were restarted on an ICI and 44 (55\%) who permanently discontinued. Median time to initial irAE was similar between the retreatment and discontinuation cohorts (2.8 vs 2.7 months, p=0.59). The type and grade of irAEs were balanced across the cohorts; however, fewer retreatment patients required corticosteroids (55.6\% vs 84.1\%, p=0.007) and hospitalizations (33.3\% vs 65.9\%, p=0.007) for irAE management compared with discontinuation patients. Median treatment holiday before reinitiation was 0.9 months (0.2–31.6). After retreatment, 50\% (n=18/36) experienced subsequent irAEs (12 new, 6 recurrent) with 7 (19\%) grade 3 events and 13 drug interruptions. Median time to irAE recurrence after retreatment was 2.8 months (range: 0.3–13.8). Retreatment resulted in 6 (23.1\%) additional responses in 26 patients whose disease had not previously responded. From first ICI initiation, median time to next therapy was 14.2 months (95\% CI 8.2 to 18.9) and 9.0 months (5.3 to 25.8), and 2-year overall survival was 76\% (95\%CI 55\% to 88\%) and 66\% (48\% to 79\%) in the retreatment and discontinuation groups, respectively.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Despite a considerable rate of irAE recurrence with retreatment after a prior clinically significant irAE, most irAEs were low grade and controllable. Prospective studies are warranted to confirm that retreatment enhances survival outcomes that justify the safety risks.},

After start of infusion, B-cell counts dropped to {\textless} 1 B cell/μL within an average of 2 days and remained essentially undetectable for the entire treatment period. By contrast, T-cell counts in all patients declined to a nadir within {\textless} 1 day and recovered to baseline within a few days. T cells then expanded and on average more than doubled over baseline within 2-3 weeks under continued infusion of blinatumomab. A significant percentage of reappearing CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells newly expressed activation marker CD69. Shortly after start of infusion, a transient release of cytokines dominated by IL-10, IL-6, and IFN-γ was observed, which no longer occurred on start of a second treatment cycle.

	abstract = {Conventionally, evaluation of a new drug, A, is done in three phases. Phase I is based on toxicity to determine a "maximum tolerable dose" (MTD) of A, phase II is conducted to decide whether A at the MTD is promising in terms of response probability, and if so a large randomized phase III trial is conducted to compare A to a control treatment,

                     usually based on survival time or progression free survival time. It is widely recognized that this paradigm has many flaws. A recent approach combines the first two phases by conducting a phase I-II trial, which chooses an optimal dose based on both efficacy and toxicity, and evaluation of A at the selected optimal phase I-II dose then is done in a phase III trial. This paper proposes a new design paradigm, motivated by the possibility that the optimal phase I-II dose may not maximize mean survival time with A. We propose a hybridized design, which we call phase I-II/III, that combines phase I-II and phase III by allowing the chosen optimal phase I-II dose of A to be re-optimized based on survival time data from phase I-II patients and the first portion of phase III. The phase I-II/III design uses adaptive randomization in phase I-II, and relies on a mixture model for the survival time distribution as a function of efficacy, toxicity, and dose. A simulation study is presented to evaluate the phase I-II/III design and compare it to the usual approach that does not re-optimize the dose of A in phase III.},

These methods are often proposed to address the conventional cytotoxic therapeutics for neoplastic diseases and cancer. Recent advances in precision medicine have motivated novel trial designs, most notably the idea of master protocol (eg, platform trial, basket trial, umbrella trial, N-of-1 trial), for the evaluation of molecularly targeted cancer therapies. In this article, we review the concepts and methodology of early-phase cancer trial designs with a focus on dose finding and treatment screening and put these methods in the context of platform trials of molecularly targeted cancer therapies. Because most cancer trial designs have been developed for cytotoxic agents, we will discuss how these time-tested design principles hold relevance for targeted cancer therapies, and we will delineate how a master protocol may serve as an efficient platform for safety and efficacy evaluations of novel targeted therapies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immuno-oncology (I-O) therapies target the host immune system, providing the potential to choose a uniform dose and schedule across tumor types. However, dose selection for I-O agents usually occurs early in clinical development and is typically based on tumor response, which may not fully represent the potential for improved overall survival. Here, we describe an integrated approach which incorporates clinical safety and efficacy data with data obtained from analyses of dose-/exposure-response (D-R/E-R) relationships, used to select a monotherapy dose for nivolumab, a programmed death-1 inhibitor, in clinical studies of different tumor types.
METHODS: Dose was selected based on anti-tumor activity and safety data from a large phase 1b, open-label, dose-escalation study of nivolumab at doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in 306 patients with advanced malignancies, and quantitative analyses were performed to characterize D-R/E-R relationships for pharmacodynamic, safety, and efficacy endpoints.
RESULTS: A maximum tolerated dose for nivolumab was not identified, and the safety profile was similar across tumor types and dose levels (0.1-10 mg/kg). Objective response rates (ORRs) were similar across doses in melanoma and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), while higher ORRs were observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg versus 1 mg/kg. Peripheral receptor occupancy was saturated at doses ≥ 0.3 mg/kg. In D-R/E-R analyses, a positive dose-dependent objective response trend was observed for each tumor type, but appeared to plateau at nivolumab doses of ≥ 1 mg/kg for melanoma and RCC, and at ≥ 3 mg/kg for NSCLC. Although there was no apparent relationship between tumor shrinkage rate and exposure, tumor progression rate appeared to decrease with increasing exposure up to a dose of 3 mg/kg Q2W for NSCLC.
CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab monotherapy at 3 mg/kg Q2W provides unified dosing across tumor types. This dose and schedule has been validated in several phase II/III studies in which overall survival was an endpoint. Integrating D-R/E-R relationships with efficacy data and a safety profile that is unique to I-O therapy is a rational approach for dose selection of these agents.},

Thirty-one patients were treated; RP2D was  established at 160 mg/m(2)/dose on the QDx2/week schedule. Common toxicities were gastrointestinal, hepatic, and hematologic.

The E-R model describes the placebo and ubrogepant treatment effects based on migraine pain endpoints (2-hour pain relief and 2-hour pain freedom) at various dose levels. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate various assumptions of placebo response in light of the high placebo response observed in one Phase II trial. A population PK model describing the effect of formulations was included in the E-R simulation framework to assess potential dose implications of a formulation switch from Phase II to Phase III. Model-based simulations predict that a dose of 25 mg or higher is likely to achieve significantly better efficacy than placebo with desirable efficacy levels.

However, for precision medicine to realize its potential, the patient's history, environment, and lifestyle must also be taken into account. Improving precision medicine requires a better understanding of the underlying reasons for the variability in drug response so as to better identify which drug or combination of drugs is likely to be most effective for an individual patient, along with consideration of the optimal dose or doses for that patient. Greater individualization of dose will be an important means to achieve more precise medicine and mitigate significant variability in drug response. Achieving this will require changes in how drugs are developed, approved, prescribed, monitored, and paid for. Each of these factors is discussed in this review.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE AND METHODS: Future progress in the care of children with cancer requires appropriate evaluations of promising new agents for pediatric indications, beginning with well-conducted phase I trials. This report summarizes current guidelines for the conduct of pediatric phase I trials and represents a consensus between American and European investigators. The primary objective of pediatric phase I trials is to define safe and appropriate doses and schedules of new agents that can subsequently be used in phase II trials to test for activity against specific childhood malignancies. Prioritization of agents for evaluation in children is critical, since many more investigational agents are evaluated in adult patients than can be systematically evaluated in children. Considerations used in prioritizing agents include activity in xenograft models, novel mechanism of action, favorable drug-resistance profile, and activity observed in adult trials of the agent.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Distinctive characteristics of pediatric phase I trials, in comparison to adult phase I trials, include the necessity for multiinstitutional participation and their higher starting dose (typically 80\% of the adult maximum-tolerated dose [MTD]), both of which reflect the relative unavailability of appropriate patients. The application of uniform eligibility criteria and standard definitions for MTD and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) help to assure that pediatric phase I trials are safely conducted and reliably identify appropriate doses and schedules of agents for phase II evaluation. Where possible, pediatric phase I trials also define the pharmacokinetic behavior of new agents in children.},

Preclinical studies have shown that Ad5/3-Delta24 achieves significant oncolysis and anti-tumor activity in ovarian cancer models. The purpose of this study was to evaluate in a phase I trial the feasibility and safety of intraperitoneal (IP) Ad5/3-Delta24 in recurrent ovarian cancer patients. METHODS: Eligible patients were treated with IP Ad5/3-Delta24 for 3 consecutive days in one of three dose cohorts ranging 1 x 10(10)-1 x 10(12)vp. Toxicity was assessed utilizing CTC grading and efficacy with RECIST. Ascites, serum, and other samples were obtained to evaluate gene transfer, generation of wildtype virus, viral shedding, and antibody response. RESULTS: Nine of 10 patients completed treatment per protocol. A total of 15 vector-related adverse events were experienced in 5 patients. These events included fever or chills, nausea, fatigue, and myalgia. All were grades 1-2 in nature, transient, and medically managed. Of the 8 treated patients evaluable for response, six patients had stable disease and 2 patients had progressive disease. Three patients had decreased CA-125 from pretreatment levels one month after treatment. Ancillary biologic studies indicated Ad5/3-Delta24 replication in patients in the higher dose cohorts. All patients experienced an anti-adenoviral neutralizing antibody effect. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the feasibility and safety of a serotype chimeric infectivity-enhanced CRAd, Ad5/3-Delta24, as a potential therapeutic option for recurrent ovarian cancer patients.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) is a potent radiosensitizer; however, its clinical utility is limited by dose-limiting systemic toxicities and the need for prolonged continuous infusion. 5-Iodo-2-pyrimidinone-2'-deoxyribose (IPdR) is an  oral prodrug of IUdR that, compared with IUdR, is easier to administer and less toxic, with a more favorable therapeutic index in preclinical studies. Here, we report the clinical and pharmacologic results of a first-in-human phase I dose escalation study of IPdR + concurrent radiation therapy (RT) in patients with advanced metastatic gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients with metastatic GI cancers referred for palliative RT to the chest, abdomen, or pelvis were eligible for study. Patients received IPdR orally once every day x 28 days beginning 7 days before the initiation of RT (37.5 Gy in 2.5  Gy x 15 fractions). A 2-part dose escalation scheme was used, pharmacokinetic studies were performed at multiple time points, and all patients were assessed for toxicity and response to Day 56. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were entered on study. Dose-limiting toxicity was encountered at 1,800 mg every day, and the recommended phase II dose is 1,200 mg every day. Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated achievable and sustainable levels of plasma IUdR {\textgreater}/=1 mumol/L (levels previously shown to mediate radiosensitization). Two complete, 3 partial, and 9 stable responses were achieved in target lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of IPdR orally every day x 28 days with RT is feasible and tolerable at doses that produce plasma IUdR levels {\textgreater}/=1 mumol/L. These results support the investigation of IPdR + RT in phase II studies.},

We designed a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of UCN-01 with prednisone in patients  with advanced malignancies. METHODS: UCN-01 was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion over 72 h in cycle 1 and 36 h in subsequent cycles. Prednisone was given orally at 60 mg/m(2) per day for five consecutive days within each 28-day cycle. Standard dose escalation was employed, and MTD was defined as the dose at which no more than one of six patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Plasma pharmacokinetics of UCN-01 were assessed. RESULTS: Fifteen patients received a total of 55 courses of treatment. The MTD and the recommended phase II dose of UCN-01 in this combination is 72 mg/m(2) total dose over 72 h for cycle 1 followed by 36 mg/m(2) per cycle over 36 h. All  patients experienced hyperglycemia but responded to insulin treatment. Hypophosphatemia was a DLT in two patients. There were no cumulative toxicities.  No objective responses were observed, but five patients had stable disease, including two patients with lymphoid malignancies who had prolonged disease stabilizations. UCN-01 has a long terminal half-life and low clearance; there was wide inter-patient variability in peak concentrations. CONCLUSION: UCN-01 can be  safely administered in combination with prednisone without unacceptable toxicity. The prolonged stable disease in two patients with lymphoid malignancies is a proof of principle for the evaluation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in oncology.},

Here, we conclude with both an overview of the various high-value applications of clinical pharmacodynamics (PD) in developmental therapeutics and an outline of the framework for incorporating PD analyses into the design of clinical trials. Given the increasingly recognized importance of determining and administering the biologically effective dose (BED) and schedule of targeted agents, we explain how clinical PD biomarkers specific to the agent mechanism of action (MOA) can be used for the development of pharmacodynamics-guided biologically effective dosage regimens (PD-BEDR) to maximize the efficacy and minimize the toxicity of targeted therapies. In addition, we discuss how MOA-based PD biomarker analyses can be used both as patient selection diagnostic tools and for designing novel drug combinations targeting the specific mutational signature of a given malignancy. We also describe the role of PD analyses in clinical trials, including for MOA confirmation and dosage regimen optimization during phase 0 trials as well as for correlating molecular changes with clinical efficacy when establishing proof-of-concept in phase I/II trials. Finally, we outline the critical technological developments that are needed to enhance the quality and quantity of future clinical PD data collection, broaden the types of molecular questions that can be answered in the clinic, and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic Acid (CDDO,  previously RTA 401) is a multifunctional molecule that controls cellular growth and differentiation. While CDDO is capable of activating the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), its apoptotic effects in malignant cells have been shown to occur independently of PPARgamma. A phase I dose-escalation study was conducted to determine the toxicity, the maximum tolerated dose, and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CDDO, administered as a 5-day continuous infusion every 28 days in patients with advanced cancers. METHODS: An accelerated titration design was followed, with one patient per cohort entered, and doses ranging from 0.6 to 38.4 mg/m(2)/h. Pharmacokinetics of CDDO was assessed and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (c-PARP), as a marker of apoptosis, was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear  cells to assess drug effect. RESULTS: Seven patients, one patient per dose level  up to dose level 7 (38.4 mg/m(2)/h), were enrolled and received a total of 11 courses of treatment. Cmax increased proportionally with dose. Preclinically determined efficacious blood level (1 muM) of drug was attained at the highest dose level. One patient, at dose level 6, experienced grade 2 mucositis, nausea,  vomiting, and anorexia. Four patients developed thromboembolic events subsequently considered as dose-limiting toxicity. No antitumor activity was noted. CONCLUSION: A causal relationship of observed thromboembolic events to CDDO was considered possible but could not be established.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: A phase I dose escalation study was performed with systemically delivered lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin (LTLD). The primary objectives were to determine the safe maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetic properties, and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of LTLD during this  combination therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects eligible for percutaneous or surgical radiofrequency (RF) ablation with primary (n = 9) or metastatic (n = 15) tumors of the liver, with four or fewer lesions as large as 7 cm in diameter, were included. RF ablation was initiated 15 minutes after starting a 30-minute intravenous LTLD infusion. Dose levels between 20 mg/m(2) and 60 mg/m(2) were evaluated. Magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and computed tomography were performed at predetermined intervals before and after treatment until evidence of recurrence was seen, administration of additional antitumor treatment was performed, or a total of 3 years had elapsed. RESULTS: DLT criteria were met at 60 mg/m(2), and the MTD was defined as 50 mg/m(2). RF ablation was performed during the peak of the plasma concentration-time curve in an effort to  yield maximal drug deposition. LTLD produced reversible, dose-dependent neutropenia and leukopenia. CONCLUSIONS: LTLD can be safely administered systemically at the MTD (50 mg/m(2)) in combination with RF ablation, with limited and manageable toxicity. Further evaluation of this agent combined with RF ablation is warranted to determine its role in the management of liver tumors.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In contemporary oncology drug development, implementation of novel early-phase designs with the ability to address multiple research objectives is needed to better refine regimens. This paper describes an adaptive design strategy for identifying a range of optimal regimens based on two endpoints within multiple cohorts. The proposed design was developed to address objectives in an early-phase trial of cancer vaccines in combination with agonistic antibodies to CD40 and CD27.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe a model-based design strategy that was developed for a trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of vaccination with (1) peptides plus CD40 antibody and TLR3 ligand, (2) systemic administration of an agonistic CD27 antibody, and (3) to assess immune response from (1) and (2) compared to optimal controls in participants with stage IIB-IV melanoma.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The proposed design is a practical adaptive method for use with combined immunotherapy regimens with multiple objectives within multiple cohorts of interest. Further advances in the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies will require new approaches that include redefining optimal strategies to take multiple regimens forward into later phases, incorporating additional endpoints in the dose selection process and testing drug combination therapies to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity. Our goal is to facilitate the acceptance and application of more novel designs in contemporary early development trials.},

Here, from subjects enrolled in an H5N1 DNA/MIV-prime-boost influenza vaccine trial, we sorted hemagglutinin cross-reactive memory B cells and identified three antibody classes, each capable of neutralizing diverse subtypes of group 1 and group 2 influenza A viruses. Co-crystal structures with hemagglutinin revealed that each class utilized characteristic germline genes and convergent sequence motifs to recognize overlapping epitopes in the hemagglutinin stem. All six analyzed subjects had sequences from at least one multidonor class, and-in half the subjects-multidonor-class sequences were recovered from {\textgreater}40\% of cross-reactive B  cells. By contrast, these multidonor-class sequences were rare in published antibody datasets. Vaccination with a divergent hemagglutinin can thus increase the frequency of B cells encoding broad influenza A-neutralizing antibodies. We propose the sequence signature-quantified prevalence of these B cells as a metric to guide universal influenza A immunization strategies.},

In this study, 2-D PAGE analysis was performed on nuclear lysates prepared from HCT-116 and A375 cells treated with 1 microM NSC724998 for 24 h and the differentially regulated spots identified by LC-MS/MS. One-hundred fourteen protein spot differentials were identified, 66 from A375 cells and 48 from HCT-116 cells. Proteins related to apoptosis changed specifically in A375 cells, whereas proteins involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system were highly enriched in treated HCT-116 cells. Importantly, 12 differentially expressed proteins (ETFA, HCC1, HNRCL, KAP1, NPM, NUCL, PRDX1, PRP19, PSB6, RAE1L, RU2A, and SFRS9) were common to both cell lines. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry confirmed significant nuclear upregulation of both the proteasome subunit PSB6 and the transcriptional repressor KAP1. Interestingly, increased KAP1 polypeptide was accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation at Ser824. Similar to gammaH2AX, KAP1 phosphorylation was consistently enhanced in a panel of 12 cell lines and in A375 xenografts following NSC 724998 treatment. In summary, these data enhance our understanding of protein dynamics in the nucleus following DNA damage and provide an alternate marker (pKAP1) with potential for monitoring clinical responses to Top1 poisons.},

Historically, simulation has been the primary option for determining sample sizes for adaptive Phase I trials, and although useful, can be problematic and time-consuming when a sample size is needed relatively quickly. We propose a computationally fast and simple approach that uses Beta distributions to approximate the posterior distributions of DLT rates of each dose and determines an appropriate sample size through posterior coverage rates. We provide sample sizes produced by our methods for a vast number of realistic Phase I trial settings and demonstrate that our sample sizes are generally larger than those produced by a competing approach that is based upon the nonparametric optimal design.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE
              Despite the fact that almost any sample of patients with a particular disease is heterogeneous, most clinical trial designs ignore the possibility that treatment or dose effects may differ between prognostic or biologically defined subgroups. This article reviews two clinical trial designs that make subgroup-specific decisions and compares each to a simpler design that ignores patient heterogeneity. The purpose is to illustrate the benefits of accounting prospectively for treatment-subgroup interactions and how utilities may be used to quantify risk-benefit trade-offs.
            
            
              METHODS
              Two Bayesian clinical trial designs that perform subgroup-specific decision making and inference based on elicited utilities of patient outcomes are reviewed. The first is a randomized comparative trial of nutritional prehabilitation for patients undergoing esophageal resection that has two prognostic subgroups and is based on postoperative morbidity score. The second is a sequentially adaptive trial of natural killer cells for treating hematologic malignancies that is based on five time-to-event outcomes and that performs safety monitoring and optimizes cell dose within six disease subgroups. Computer simulations under a range of different scenarios are presented for each design to establish its operating characteristics and compare it to a more conventional design that ignores patient heterogeneity.
            
            
              RESULTS
              Each design has attractive operating characteristics, is greatly superior to a simplified design that ignores patient subgroups, is robust to deviations from its assumed statistical model, and is feasible to use for conducting trials.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Bayesian designs that make subgroup-specific decisions in randomized comparative trials or sequentially adaptive early-phase dose-finding trials are superior to designs that ignore patient heterogeneity. Using elicited utilities of complex patient outcomes to quantify risk-benefit trade-offs provides a practical and ethical basis for decision making and treatment evaluation in clinical trials.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Only one chemical class of topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitors is FDA approved, the camptothecins with irinotecan and topotecan widely used. Because of their limitations (chemical instability, drug efflux-mediated resistance, and diarrhea), novel TOP1 inhibitors are warranted. Indenoisoquinoline non-camptothecin topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitors overcome chemical instability  and drug resistance that limit camptothecin use. Three indenoisoquinolines, LMP400 (indotecan), LMP776 (indimitecan), and LMP744, were examined in a phase I  study for lymphoma-bearing dogs to evaluate differential efficacy, pharmacodynamics, toxicology, and pharmacokinetics. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eighty-four client-owned dogs with lymphomas were enrolled in dose-escalation cohorts for each indenoisoquinoline, with an expansion phase for LMP744. Efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and target engagement were determined.  RESULTS: The MTDs were 17.5 mg/m(2) for LMP 776 and 100 mg/m(2) for LMP744; bone  marrow toxicity was dose-limiting; up to 65 mg/m(2) LMP400 was well-tolerated and MTD was not reached. None of the drugs induced notable diarrhea. Sustained tumor  accumulation was observed for LMP744; gammaH2AX induction was demonstrated in tumors 2 and 6 hours after treatment; a decrease in TOP1 protein was observed in  most lymphoma samples across all compounds and dose levels, which is consistent with the fact that tumor response was also observed at low doses LMP744. Objective responses were documented for all indenoisoquinolines; efficacy (13/19  dogs) was greatest for LMP744. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate proof-of-mechanism for indenoisoquinoline TOP1 inhibitors supporting their further clinical development. They also highlight the value of the NCI Comparative Oncology Program (https://ccr.cancer.gov/Comparative-Oncology-Program) for evaluating novel therapies in immunocompetent pets with cancers.},

For 15 selected regions and their respective SNPs, we also assessed interaction with alcohol and tobacco use. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the main effect of SNPs (P(trend)) and interaction with alcohol/tobacco intake. Gene- and pathway-level associations and interactions (P(gene interaction)) were evaluated by combining P(trend) values using the adaptive rank-truncated product method. While we found  associations between PTC risk and nine SNPs (P(trend) {\textless}/= 0.01) and seven genes/regions (P(region){\textless}0.05), none remained significant after correction for the false discovery rate. We found a significant interaction between UGT2B7 and NAT1 genes and alcohol intake (P(gene interaction)=0.01 and 0.02 respectively) and between the CYP26B1 gene and tobacco intake (P(gene interaction)=0.02). Our results are suggestive of interaction between the genetic polymorphisms in several detoxification genes and alcohol or tobacco intake on risk of PTC.

A 3 + 3 dose escalation tested daily oral capsule olaparib (100 or 200mg every 12 hours; dose level1 or 2) with carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) on day 8 (AUC3 day 8), then every  21 days. For dose levels 3 to 6, patients were given olaparib days 1 to 7 at 200  and 400 mg every 12 hours, with carboplatin AUC3 to 5 on day 1 or 2 every 21 days; a maximum of eight combination cycles were permitted, after which daily maintenance of olaparib 400mg every12 hours continued until progression. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined in the first two cycles. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected for polymorphism analysis and polyADP-ribose incorporation. Paired tumor biopsies (before/after cycle 1) were obtained for biomarker proteomics and apoptosis endpoints. RESULTS: Forty-five women (37 OvCa/8 BrCa) were treated. Dose-limiting toxicity was not reached on the intermittent schedule. Expansion proceeded with olaparib 400mg every 12 hours on  days 1 to 7/carboplatin AUC5. Grade 3/4 adverse events included neutropenia (42.2\%), thrombocytopenia (20.0\%), and anemia (15.6\%). Responses included 1 complete response (1 BrCa; 23 months) and 21 partial responses (50.0\%; 15 OvCa; 6 BrCa; median = 16 [4 to {\textgreater}45] in OvCa and 10 [6 to {\textgreater}40] months in BrCa). Proteomic analysis suggests high pretreatment pS209-eIF4E and FOXO3a correlated with duration of response (two-sided P {\textless} .001; Pearson's R (2) = 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Olaparib capsules 400mg every 12 hours on days 1 to 7/carboplatin AUC5 is safe and has activity in gBRCAm BrCa/OvCa patients. Exploratory translational studies  indicate pretreatment tissue FOXO3a expression may be predictive for response to  therapy, requiring prospective validation.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Endoglin, an endothelial cell membrane receptor expressed on angiogenic  tumor vessels, is essential for angiogenesis and upregulated in the setting of VEGF inhibition. TRC105 is an anti-endoglin IgG1 monoclonal antibody that potentiates VEGF inhibitors in preclinical models. This study assessed safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of TRC105 in combination with bevacizumab. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients (n = 38) with advanced solid tumors, Eastern Cooperative Group performance status 0-1, and normal organ function were  treated with escalating doses of TRC105 plus bevacizumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity using a standard 3 + 3 phase I design. RESULTS: TRC105 and bevacizumab were well tolerated at their recommended single-agent doses (10 mg/kg) when the initial dose of TRC105 was delayed by one  week and divided over 2 days to limit the frequency of headache. The concurrent administration of bevacizumab and TRC105 did not otherwise potentiate known toxicities of TRC105 or bevacizumab. Hypertension and proteinuria were observed,  though not at rates expected for single-agent bevacizumab. Several patients who had previously progressed on bevacizumab or VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGFR TKI) treatment experienced reductions in tumor volume, including two partial responses by RECIST, and 6 remained without progression for longer periods than during their prior VEGF inhibitor therapy. CONCLUSIONS: TRC105 was well tolerated with bevacizumab and clinical activity was observed in a VEGF inhibitor-refractory population. Ongoing clinical trials are testing TRC105 in combination with bevacizumab in glioblastoma and with VEGFR TKIs in renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and soft tissue sarcoma.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The worst Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in history has resulted  in more than 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths. We present the final results of two  phase 1 trials of an attenuated, replication-competent, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine candidate designed to prevent EVD. METHODS: We conducted two phase 1, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation trials of an rVSV-based vaccine candidate expressing the glycoprotein of a Zaire  strain of Ebola virus (ZEBOV). A total of 39 adults at each site (78 participants in all) were consecutively enrolled into groups of 13. At each site, volunteers received one of three doses of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine (3 million plaque-forming units [PFU], 20 million PFU, or 100 million PFU) or placebo. Volunteers at one of the sites received a second dose at day 28. Safety and immunogenicity were assessed. RESULTS: The most common adverse events were injection-site pain, fatigue, myalgia, and headache. Transient rVSV viremia was noted in all the vaccine recipients after dose 1. The rates of adverse events and viremia were lower after the second dose than after the first dose. By day 28, all the vaccine recipients had seroconversion as assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against the glycoprotein of the ZEBOV-Kikwit strain. At day 28, geometric mean titers of antibodies against ZEBOV glycoprotein were higher in the groups that received 20 million PFU or 100 million PFU than in the group that received 3 million PFU, as assessed by ELISA and by pseudovirion neutralization assay. A second dose at 28 days after dose 1 significantly increased antibody titers at day 56, but the effect was diminished at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: This Ebola vaccine candidate elicited anti-Ebola antibody responses. After vaccination, rVSV viremia occurred frequently but was transient. These results support further evaluation of the vaccine dose of 20 million PFU for preexposure prophylaxis and  suggest that a second dose may boost antibody responses.

ICL confers an increased risk of opportunistic infections and has no established treatment. Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is fundamental for thymopoiesis, T-cell homeostasis, and survival of mature T cells, which provides  a rationale for its potential use as an immunotherapeutic agent for ICL. We performed an open-label phase 1/2A dose-escalation trial of 3 subcutaneous doses  of recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) per week in patients with ICL who were at risk of disease progression. The primary objectives of the study were to assess safety and the immunomodulatory effects of rhIL-7 in ICL patients. Injection site reactions were the most frequently reported adverse events. One patient experienced a hypersensitivity reaction and developed non-neutralizing anti-IL-7  antibodies. Patients with autoimmune diseases that required systemic therapy at screening were excluded from the study; however, 1 participant developed systemic lupus erythematosus while on study and was excluded from further rhIL-7 dosing. Quantitatively, rhIL-7 led to an increase in the number of circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells and tissue-resident CD3 T cells in the gut mucosa and bone marrow. Functionally, these T cells were capable of producing cytokines after mitogenic stimulation. rhIL-7 was well tolerated at biologically active doses and may represent a promising therapeutic intervention in ICL.

To define the relative contribution of PARP inhibition to the observed clinical activity, we conducted a randomized phase II trial to determine the response rate of veliparib in combination with cyclophosphamide compared with cyclophosphamide alone in patients with pretreated BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer or  in patients with pretreated primary peritoneal, fallopian tube, or high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Adult patients were randomized to receive cyclophosphamide alone (50 mg orally once daily) or with veliparib (60 mg orally once daily) in 21-day cycles. Crossover to the combination was allowed at disease progression. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were enrolled and 72 were evaluable for response; 38 received cyclophosphamide alone and 37 the combination as their initial treatment regimen. Treatment was well tolerated. One complete response was observed in each arm, with three partial responses (PR) in the combination arm and six PRs in the cyclophosphamide alone arm. Genetic sequence and expression analyses were performed for 211 genes  involved in DNA repair; none of the detected genetic alterations were significantly associated with treatment benefit. CONCLUSION: This is the first trial that evaluated single-agent, low-dose cyclophosphamide in HGSOC, peritoneal, fallopian tube, and BRCA-mutant ovarian cancers. It was well tolerated and clinical activity was observed; the addition of veliparib at 60 mg  daily did not improve either the response rate or the median progression-free survival.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: In preclinical studies, the PARP inhibitor veliparib enhanced the antileukemic action of temozolomide through potentiation of DNA damage. Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 study of temozolomide with escalating doses of veliparib in patients with relapsed, refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or AML arising from aggressive myeloid malignancies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients received veliparib [20-200 mg once a day on day 1 and twice daily on days 4-12 in cycle 1 (days 1-8 in cycle {\textgreater}/=2)] and temozolomide [150-200 mg/m(2)  daily on days 3-9 in cycle 1 (days 1-5 in cycle {\textgreater}/=2)] every 28 to 56 days. Veliparib pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [ability to inhibit poly(ADP-ribose) polymer (PAR) formation and induce H2AX phosphorylation] were assessed. Pretreatment levels of MGMT and PARP1 protein, methylation of the MGMT  promoter, and integrity of the Fanconi anemia pathway were also examined. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were treated at seven dose levels. Dose-limiting toxicities were oral mucositis and esophagitis lasting {\textgreater}7 days. The MTD was veliparib 150 mg twice daily with temozolomide 200 mg/m(2) daily. The complete response (CR) rate was 17\% (8/48 patients). Veliparib exposure as well as inhibition of PAR polymer formation increased dose proportionately. A veliparib-induced increase in H2AX phosphorylation in CD34(+) cells was observed  in responders. Three of 4 patients with MGMT promoter methylation achieved CR. CONCLUSIONS: Veliparib plus temozolomide is well tolerated, with activity in advanced AML. Further evaluation of this regimen and of treatment-induced phosphorylation of H2AX and MGMT methylation as potential response predictors appears warranted. Clin Cancer Res; 23(3); 697-706.

	abstract = {Purpose Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a multicentric tumor caused by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Unmet needs include therapies that are oral, anthracycline sparing, and deliverable in resource-limited settings. We evaluated pomalidomide, an oral immune modulatory agent, in patients with symptomatic KS. Methods The primary objectives were to assess tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and activity. Initial dosage level was 5 mg once per day for 21 days per 28-day cycle, with a de-escalated level of 3 mg if not tolerable, and aspirin 81 mg once per day thromboprophylaxis. HIV-infected patients required controlled viremia with either persistent KS despite 3 months of antiretroviral therapy (ART) or progressive KS despite 2 months of ART. Evaluations included tumor response and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Results Twenty-two patients were treated;  15 (68\%) were HIV infected, 17 (77\%) had advanced (T1) disease, and 19 (86\%) previous KS therapy excluding ART. All were treated with 5 mg because no dose-limiting toxicities occurred. Over 156 cycles, the grade 3/4 adverse events  possibly attributable to therapy were neutropenia (23 cycles, 10 patients), infection (1 cycle), and edema (1 cycle). Sixteen patients responded (73\%; 95\% CI, 50\% to 89\%): nine of 15 HIV-infected patients (60\%; 95\% CI, 32\% to 84\%) and all seven HIV-uninfected patients (100\%; 95\% CI, 59\% to 100\%). Median time to response was 4 weeks (range, 4 to 36 weeks). HRQL showed no impairment during therapy and improved satisfaction with appearance at end therapy ( P = .03). Significant increases in CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells were seen in patients with and without HIV, together with a transient increase in Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus viral load at week 4 ( P = .05). Conclusion Pomalidomide is well tolerated and active in KS regardless of HIV status. Responses were rapid, with improved self-reported outcomes, and occurred in advanced and heavily pretreated  disease. Correlative studies support, at least in part, an immunologic mechanism  of activity.},

	abstract = {LESSONS LEARNED: Oral targeted agents are desirable for treatment of Kaposi sarcoma (KS); however, in patients with HIV, drug-drug interactions must be considered. In this study to treat KS, sorafenib was poorly tolerated at doses less than those approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for hepatocellular carcinoma and other cancers, and showed only modest activity.Sorafenib's metabolism occurs via the CYP3A4 pathway, which is inhibited by ritonavir, a commonly used antiretroviral agent used by most patients in this  study. Strong CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir may contribute to the observed sorafenib toxicity.Alternate antiretroviral agents without predicted interactions are preferred for co-administration in patients with HIV and cancers for which sorafenib is indicated. BACKGROUND: We conducted a phase Ib study of sorafenib, a vascular epithelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), c-kit, and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-targeted treatment in Kaposi sarcoma (KS). We evaluated drug-drug interactions between sorafenib and ritonavir, an HIV medication with strong CYP3A4 inhibitory activity. METHODS: Two cohorts were enrolled: HIV-related KS on ritonavir (Cohort R) and HIV-related or classical KS  not receiving ritonavir (Cohort NR). Sorafenib dose level 1 in cohort R (R1) was  200 mg daily and 200 mg every 12 hours in cohort NR (NR1). Steady-state pharmacokinetics were evaluated at cycle 1, day 8. KS responses and correlative factors were assessed. RESULTS: Ten patients (nine HIV(+)) were enrolled: R1 (eight), NR1 (two). Median CD4(+) count (HIV(+)) was 500 cells/microL. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were grade 3 elevated lipase (R1), grade 4 thrombocytopenia (R1), and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (NR1). Two of seven evaluable patients had a partial response (PR; 29\%; 95\% CI 4\%-71\%). Steady-state  area under the curve of the dosing interval (AUCTAU) of sorafenib was not significantly affected by ritonavir; however, a trend for decreased AUCTAU of the CYP3A4 metabolite sorafenib-N-oxide (3.8-fold decrease; p = .08) suggests other metabolites may be increased. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib was poorly tolerated, and anti-KS activity was modest. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may contribute to sorafenib toxicity, and ritonavir has previously been shown to be a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Alternate antiretroviral agents without predicted interactions should be used when possible for concurrent administration with sorafenib. The Oncologist 2017;22:505-e49.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: PARP is essential for recognition and repair of DNA damage. In preclinical models, PARP inhibitors modulate topoisomerase I inhibitor-mediated DNA damage. This phase I study determined the MTD, dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of veliparib, an orally bioavailable PARP1/2 inhibitor, in combination with irinotecan. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with advanced solid tumors were treated with 100 mg/m(2) irinotecan on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Twice-daily oral dosing of veliparib (10-50 mg) occurred on days 3 to 14 (cycle 1) and days -1 to 14 (subsequent cycles) followed by a 6-day rest. PK studies were conducted with both agents alone and in combination. Paired tumor biopsies were obtained after irinotecan alone and veliparib/irinotecan to evaluate PARP1/2 inhibition and explore DNA damage signals (nuclear gamma-H2AX and pNBS1). RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were treated. DLTs included fatigue, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, and  neutropenia. The MTD was 100 mg/m(2) irinotecan (days 1 and 8) combined with veliparib 40 mg twice daily (days -1-14) on a 21-day cycle. Of 31 response-evaluable patients, there were six (19\%) partial responses. Veliparib exhibited linear PK, and there were no apparent PK interactions between veliparib and irinotecan. At all dose levels, veliparib reduced tumor poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) content in the presence of irinotecan. Several samples showed increases in  gamma-H2AX and pNBS1 after veliparib/irinotecan compared with irinotecan alone. CONCLUSIONS: Veliparib can be safely combined with irinotecan at doses that inhibit PARP catalytic activity. Preliminary antitumor activity justifies further evaluation of the combination.

This study evaluated veliparib incorporation into leukemia induction therapy using a previously described topotecan/carboplatin backbone.Experimental Design: Employing a 3+3 trial design, we administered escalating doses of veliparib combined with topotecan + carboplatin in relapsed or refractory acute leukemias, aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).Results: A total of 99 patients received veliparib 10-100 mg orally twice  daily on days 1-8, 1-14, or 1-21 along with continuous infusion topotecan 1.0-1.2 mg/m(2)/d + carboplatin 120-150 mg/m(2)/d on days 3-7. The MTD was veliparib 80 mg twice daily for up to 21 days with topotecan 1.2 mg/m(2)/d + carboplatin 150 mg/m(2)/d. Mucositis was dose limiting and correlated with high veliparib concentrations. The response rate was 33\% overall (33/99: 14 CR, 11 CRi, 8 PR) but was 64\% (14/22) for patients with antecedent or associated aggressive MPNs or CMML. Leukemias with baseline DNA repair defects, as evidenced by impaired DNA damage-induced FANCD2 monoubiquitination, had improved survival [HR = 0.56 (95\% confidence interval, 0.27-0.92)]. A single 80-mg dose of veliparib, as well as veliparib in combination with topotecan + carboplatin, induced DNA damage as manifested by histone H2AX phosphorylation in CD34(+) leukemia cells, with greater phosphorylation in cells from responders.Conclusions: The veliparib/topotecan/carboplatin combination warrants further investigation, particularly in patients with aggressive MPNs, CMML, and MPN- or CMML-related acute leukemias.

The primary objective is to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD); secondary objectives include pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and best overall response.Results: Nineteen heavily pretreated patients with ECOG 0-1 have received M7824. Grade {\textgreater}/=3 treatment-related adverse  events occurred in four patients (skin infection secondary to localized bullous pemphigoid, asymptomatic lipase increase, colitis with associated anemia, and gastroparesis with hypokalemia). The MTD was not reached. M7824 saturated peripheral PD-L1 and sequestered any released plasma TGFbeta1, -beta2, and -beta3 throughout the dosing period at {\textgreater}1 mg/kg. There were signs of efficacy across all dose levels, including one ongoing confirmed complete response (cervical cancer), two durable confirmed partial responses (PR; pancreatic cancer; anal cancer), one near-PR (cervical cancer), and two cases of prolonged stable disease in patients  with growing disease at study entry (pancreatic cancer; carcinoid).Conclusions: M7824 has a manageable safety profile in patients with heavily pretreated advanced solid tumors. Early signs of efficacy are encouraging, and multiple expansion cohorts are ongoing in a range of tumors. Clin Cancer Res; 24(6);},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of (18)F-DCFBC PET/CT, a first-generation (18)F-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted agent, and (18)F-NaF PET/CT, a sensitive marker of osteoblastic activity, in a prospective cohort of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Methods: Twenty-eight prostate cancer patients with metastatic disease on conventional imaging prospectively received up to 4 PET/CT scans. All  patients completed baseline (18)F-DCFBC PET/CT and (18)F-NaF PET/CT scans, and 23 patients completed follow-up imaging, with a median follow-up interval of 5.7 mo  (range, 4.2-12.6 mo). Lesion detection was compared across the 2 PET/CT agents at each time point. Detection and SUV characteristics of each PET/CT agent were compared with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and treatment status at the time of baseline imaging using nonparametric statistical testing (Spearman correlation, Wilcoxon rank). Results: Twenty-six patients had metastatic disease  detected on (18)F-NaF or (18)F-DCFBC at baseline, and 2 patients were negative on both scans. Three patients demonstrated soft tissue-only disease. Of 241 lesions  detected at baseline, 56 were soft-tissue lesions identified by (18)F-DCFBC only  and 185 bone lesions detected on (18)F-NaF or (18)F-DCFBC. (18)F-NaF detected significantly more bone lesions than (18)F-DCFBC (P {\textless} 0.001). Correlation of PSA  with patient-level SUV metrics was strong in (18)F-DCFBC (rho {\textgreater} 0.5, P {\textless} 0.01) and poor in (18)F-NaF (rho {\textless} 0.3, P {\textgreater} 0.1). When PSA levels were combined with treatment status, patients with below-median levels of PSA ({\textless}2 ng/mL) on androgen deprivation therapy (n = 11) demonstrated more lesions on (18)F-NaF than (18)F-DCFBC (P = 0.02). In PSA greater than 2 ng/mL, patients on androgen deprivation therapy (n = 8) showed equal to or more lesions on (18)F-DCFBC than on (18)F-NaF. Conclusion: The utility of PSMA-targeting imaging in metastatic prostate cancer appears to depend on patient disease course and treatment status. Compared with (18)F-NaF PET/CT, (18)F-DCFBC PET/CT detected significantly fewer bone lesions in the setting of early or metastatic castrate-sensitive disease on  treatment. However, in advanced metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, (18)F-DCFBC PET/CT shows good concordance with NaF PET/CT.},

We hypothesized enhanced DNA damage by olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, and reduced VEGF signaling by cediranib, a VEGFR1-3 inhibitor, would complement anti-tumor activity of durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, and the 3-drug combination  would be tolerable. METHODS: This phase 1 study tested the 3-drug combination in  a 3 + 3 dose escalation. Cediranib was taken intermittently (5 days on/2 days off) at 15 or 20 mg (dose levels 1 and 2, respectively) with durvalumab 1500 mg IV every 4 weeks, and olaparib tablets 300 mg twice daily. The primary end point  was the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Response rate, pharmacokinetic (PK), and correlative analyses were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Nine patients (7 ovarian/1 endometrial/1 triple negative breast cancers, median 3 prior therapies  [2-6]) were treated. Grade 3/4 adverse events include hypertension (1/9), anemia  (1/9) and lymphopenia (3/9). No patients experienced dose limiting toxicities. The RP2D is cediranib, 20 mg (5 days on/2 days off) with full doses of durvalumab and olaparib. Four patients had partial responses (44\%) and 3 had stable disease  lasting {\textgreater}/=6 months, yielding a 67\% clinical benefit rate. No significant effects on olaparib or cediranib PK parameters from the presence of durvalumab, or the co-administration of cediranib or olaparib were identified. Tumoral PD-L1 expression correlated with clinical benefit but cytokines and peripheral immune subsets did not. CONCLUSIONS: The RP2D is tolerable and has preliminary activity  in recurrent women's cancers. A phase 2 expansion study is now enrolling for recurrent ovarian cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: Although inhibition of angiogenesis is an effective strategy for cancer treatment, acquired resistance to antiangiogenic therapy is common. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that regulates various oncogenic signaling pathways involved in acquired resistance and has been shown to play a role in angiogenesis. Combining an antiangiogenic agent with an Hsp90 inhibitor has therefore been proposed as a strategy for preventing resistance and improving antitumor activity. We conducted a single-arm phase I study evaluating  the combination of ziv-aflibercept, an antiangiogenic drug, with the Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib. METHODS: Adult patients were eligible if they had recurrent or metastatic gastrointestinal carcinomas, nonsquamous non-small cell lung carcinomas, urothelial carcinomas, or sarcomas that had progressed after at least one line of standard therapy. Ziv-aflibercept was administered intravenously on days 1 and 15, and ganetespib was administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15, of each 28-day cycle. RESULTS: Five patients were treated with the combination. Although three patients achieved stable disease, study treatment was associated with several serious and unexpected adverse events. CONCLUSION: The dose escalation phase of this study was not completed, but the limited data obtained suggest that this combination may be too toxic when administered on this dosing schedule.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The histone deacetylase inhibitor belinostat has activity in various cancers. Because belinostat is metabolized by the liver, reduced hepatic clearance could lead to excessive drug accumulation and increased toxicity. Safety data in patients with liver dysfunction are needed for this drug to reach  its full potential in the clinic. METHODS: We performed a phase 1 trial to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics of belinostat in patients with advanced cancer and varying degrees of liver dysfunction. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were enrolled and divided into cohorts based on liver function. In patients with mild dysfunction, the MTD was the same  as the recommended phase 2 dose (1000 mg/m(2) /day). Belinostat was well tolerated in patients with moderate and severe liver dysfunction, although the trial was closed before the MTD in these cohorts could be determined. The mean clearance of belinostat was 661 mL/min/m(2) in patients with normal liver function, compared to 542, 505 and 444 mL/min/m(2) in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic dysfunction. Although this trial was not designed to  assess clinical activity, of the 47 patients evaluable for response, 13 patients  (28\%) experienced stable disease. CONCLUSION: While a statistically significant difference in clearance indicates increased belinostat exposure with worsening liver function, no relationship was observed between belinostat exposure and toxicity. An assessment of belinostat metabolites revealed significant differences in metabolic pathway capability in patients with differing levels of  liver dysfunction. Further studies are needed to establish formal dosing guidelines in this patient population.},

            High-dose therapy with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) offers effective control and potential cure of hematopoietic malignancies, but with the cost of associated morbidity that includes adverse effects on quality of life (QOL). A growing body of literature has characterized this impact. Longitudinal studies suggest early moderate impairments that largely return to pretransplantation levels by day 100; the majority of studies suggest that greater than 60\% of patients report good to excellent QOL in years 1 to 4 after HCT. Comparisons of allogeneic HCT with autologous HCT and standard-dose chemotherapy suggest impairments in QOL and a different trajectory of recovery in allogeneic HCT, but these conclusions are limited by confounding variables. Cross-sectional studies suggest larger and more persistent decrements in QOL in comparison with matched noncancer controls and population normative data. Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are significant threats to QOL. Behavioral interventions show promise to maintain or improve quality of life after allogeneic HCT. The review concludes with recommendations to investigators and clinicians as the state of this research advances.},

	abstract = {Cancer chemotherapy provides variably effective treatment for the majority of forms of human cancer and curative treatment for some 12 categories of cancer. Curative treatment is defined as the proportion of patients who survive beyond the time after which the risk of treatment failure approaches zero, i.e., the disease-free survival plateau. This progress has resulted from a closely integrated scientific effort, including drug development, pharmacology, preclinical modeling, experimental design with respect to clinical trials, quantitative criteria for response, and a series of clinical trials (initially in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia) in which the importance of complete remission, of dose and schedule, of sequencing chemotherapeutic agents, of pharmacological sanctuaries, and particularly of combination chemotherapy was studied. The principles derived from these studies, particularly those relating to combination chemotherapy, resulted in curative treatment for disseminated Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, pediatric solid tumors, testicular cancer, and limited small cell lung cancer. Many patients with certain stages of solid tumors, such as breast cancer and osteogenic sarcoma, are at high risk of having disseminated microscopic disease. Experimental studies indicate that treatment which is only partially effective against macroscopic disease is much more effective against microscopic tumors. Therefore chemotherapy is administered immediately following control of the primary tumor in patients at high risk of having disseminated microscopic disease, a treatment known as adjuvant chemotherapy. This program has been highly successful in increasing the cure rate in patients with pediatric solid tumors and in prolonging disease-free survival in patients with premenopausal breast cancer. Given dissemination of the technology, it is estimated that 15,000-30,000 patients per year are potentially curable in the United States. Curability of cancer by chemotherapy generally is inversely related to age, i.e., the above tumors are most common in children and young adults. There are new and promising treatment strategies, such as neoadjuvant chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation. The revolution in molecular and cellular biology is providing an increase in targets, rationale, and opportunity for more effective and novel chemotherapeutic approaches.},

Interventions which result in greater log kill can be expected to produce improved clinical results. The application of log-kill concepts to human breast cancer growth, which appears to follow Gompertzian kinetics, suggests not only that the use of non-cross-resistant drugs is important, but that dose-dense schedules may have an advantage over conventional schedules of drug administration. Sequential therapy may allow dose-dense administration of cytotoxic agents and encourage the integration of new biological agents into combination regimens, particularly with the taxanes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most phase I clinical trials conducted at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center use the algorithmic 3 + 3 design, despite the availability of more advanced model-based designs such as the continual reassessment method.
PURPOSE: Through simple statistical modeling and computing, we develop a dose-finding design that can be easily understood and implemented by non-statisticians.
METHODS: We propose a beta/binomial Bayesian model and a probabilistic up-and-down rule that allow all possible dose-assignment actions to be tabulated in a spreadsheet. We have developed an Excel macro (available at http://odin.mdacc. tmc.edu/{\textasciitilde}yuanj) that generates trial monitoring tables, which contain the dose-assignment actions corresponding to various toxicity outcomes.
RESULTS: The new design outperforms the 3 + 3 design and performs comparably to other model-based methods in the literature.
LIMITATIONS: The proposed method assumes that the observed toxicity is a binary variable and that toxicity increases with dose level.
CONCLUSION: The new dose-finding design enables physicians to readily determine dose assignments for new patients by referencing a trial monitoring table.},

	abstract = {The ADEPT software package is not a statistical method in its own right as implied by Gerke and Siedentop (Statist. Med. 2008; DOI: 10.1002/sim.3037). ADEPT implements two-parameter CRM models as described in O'Quigley et al. (Biometrics 1990; 46(1):33-48). All of the basic ideas (use of a two-parameter logistic model, use of a two-dimensional prior for the unknown slope and intercept parameters, sequential estimation and subsequent patient allocation based on minimization of some loss function, flexibility to use cohorts instead of one by one inclusion) are strictly identical. The only, and quite trivial, difference arises in the setting of the prior. O'Quigley et al. (Biometrics 1990; 46(1):33-48) used priors having an analytic expression whereas Whitehead and Brunier (Statist. Med. 1995; 14:33-48) use pseudo-data to play the role of the prior. The question of interest is whether two-parameter CRM works as well, or better, than the one-parameter CRM recommended in O'Quigley et al. (Biometrics 1990; 46(1):33-48). Gerke and Siedentop argue that it does. The published literature suggests otherwise. The conclusions of Gerke and Siedentop stem from three highly particular, and somewhat contrived, situations. Unlike one-parameter CRM (Biometrika 1996; 83:395-405; J. Statist. Plann. Inference 2006; 136:1765-1780; Biometrika 2005; 92:863-873), no statistical properties appear to have been studied for two-parameter CRM. In particular, for two-parameter CRM, the parameter estimates are inconsistent. This ought to be a source of major concern to those proposing its use. Worse still, for finite samples the behavior of estimates can be quite wild despite having incorporated the kind of dampening priors discussed by Gerke and Siedentop. An example in which we illustrate this behavior describes a single patient included at level 1 of 6 levels and experiencing a dose limiting toxicity. The subsequent recommendation is to experiment at level 6! Such problematic behavior is not common. Even so, we show that the allocation behavior of two-parameter CRM is very much less stable than that of one-parameter CRM.},

	abstract = {In phase I oncology trials conducted over the past few decades, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has usually been estimated by the traditional escalation rule (TER), which traces back to 1973. In the meantime, new methods have been proposed which hope to estimate the true MTD more precisely than the TER while using less patients. In this simulation study, TER is compared with the accelerated titration dose design (ATD), two up-and-down designs (biased coin design, r-in-a-row (RIAR)), the maximum likelihood version of the continual reassessment method (CRML), and a Bayesian method that is implemented in the software Bayesian ADEPT (assisted decision-making in early phase trials). Each design was applied to 50,000 simulated studies. The designs were then compared for accuracy in detecting the true MTD (which is known here), while taking into account the average number of patients and toxicities per run. In terms of accuracy, ADEPT outperformed the other methods in the scenario with medium toxicity and was close to the best methods in the low and high toxic scenarios. The average number of patients needed per run was the lowest for TER in the scenario with low toxicity and for ADEPT in the remaining scenarios. The longer the escalation path to the target region of the MTD, the more the difference in the average number of patients per run pronounced between TER and ADEPT. TER induced least toxicities in all scenarios. ADEPT turned out to be quick and accurate in determining the MTD, while TER was the safest but least accurate method. CRML was as accurate as TER, and the up-and-down designs did not excel. Bayesian ADEPT is considered a valuable tool for the conduct of phase I dose-escalation trials in oncology, but careful preparation is indispensable before its practical use.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dose individualization can reduce variability in exposure. The objective of this work was to quantify, through pharmacokinetic (PK) simulation, the potential for reducing the variability in exposure by dose individualization for a drug with moderate PK variability between subjects and between occasions within a subject, and a narrow therapeutic window.
METHODS: Using a population PK model that includes between-subject and between-occasion variability for apparent clearance, individual PK profiles in a trial of 300 subjects after a test dose were simulated. From the simulated data, datasets were created mimicking various sampling regimens (from single predose sample to full profile samples over 12 hours) on 1 or more occasions (1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 visits). Using these datasets, individual apparent clearance values were estimated, which were then used to calculate an individualized dose for a predefined target area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), based on the available formulation strengths. The proportion of people whose mean AUC was within a predefined therapeutic AUC range was calculated for the test (before) and the individualized dose (after), and compared between the different sampling scenarios.
RESULTS: The maximum increase in proportion of subjects with an AUC within the range was 20\%. To achieve this benefit, PK samples over 4 hours from 100 dosing occasions were required. As a result of the dose adjustment, the AUC of 7.3\% of the subjects moved from inside the therapeutic range to outside of the range.
CONCLUSIONS: This work shows how modeling and simulation can help assess the benefit and risk of dose individualization for a compound with variability between subjects and between occasions. The framework can be applied to similar situations with a defined set of conditions (eg, therapeutic window, tablet strengths, and PK and/or pharmacodynamic sampling scheme) to inform dose change and to assess the utility of dose individualization against certain success criteria.},

Although many drugs require dose individualisation in clinical practice, dose-finding trials usually aim to identify an optimal dose for the patient population. Such a dose would be suboptimal for many patients. Simulations show that individualised dose titration, balancing efficacy against toxicity, can remarkably increase the response rate - doubling it in some situations. Dose titration in a clinical trial can efficiently establish the realistic expectations for the drug's true utility in a trial setting that reflects clinical practice, as well as generate important knowledge to guide patient care through informative drug labels. This design answers key questions truly relevant to patient care that other designs cannot - will a patient benefit from a given therapy, to what extent and at what dose? Therefore, response-based dose titration should be considered for dose-finding trials, where appropriate, for drugs that will eventually be used this way in the clinic.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined seven trials in 1,747 patients with metastatic or locally advanced urothelial cancer that led to approval of an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody. Five trials enrolled patients who had received prior platinum-based therapy, and two enrolled patients who were cisplatin ineligible. The data sets were searched for AESIs, related AESIs, imAEs, and related imAEs. The relationship to study drug was determined by the investigator. ImAEs were defined as AESIs treated with topical or systemic corticosteroids.
RESULTS: In these exploratory analyses, a related AESI was reported in 64\% of responding patients and in 34\% of patients who did not respond to the anti-PD-1/L1 antibody, whereas a related imAE occurred in 28\% and 12\% of patients who did and did not respond to study drug, respectively. In a responder analysis, an increase in overall survival was seen in patients with related AESIs compared with those with no related AESIs (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95\% CI, 0.39 to 0.52). Fifty-seven percent of responding patients with a related AESI reported the AESI before documentation of response.
CONCLUSION: Patients who responded to treatment with an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody were more likely to report a related AESI or related imAE. This relationship did not seem to be due to the increased duration of exposure in responding patients. Systemic corticosteroid use did not appear to affect the duration of response.},

The most common approach to testing for bioequivalence is the two one-sided tests procedure. No explicit mathematical formula for the power function in the context of the two one-sided tests procedure exists in the statistical literature, although the exact power based on Owen's special case of bivariate noncentral t-distribution has been tabulated and graphed. Several approximations have previously been published for the probability of rejection in the two one-sided tests procedure for crossover bioequivalence studies. These approximations and associated sample size formulas are reviewed in this article and compared for various parameter combinations with exact power formulas derived here, which are computed analytically as univariate integrals and which have been validated by Monte Carlo simulations. The exact formulas for power and sample size are shown to improve markedly in realistic parameter settings over the previous approximations.},

Initial experimentation and sequential updating are carried out in a natural way within the context of a Bayesian framework. In this paper we argue that such a framework is easily changed to a more classic one leaning upon likelihood theory. The essential features of the continual reassessment method remain unchanged. In particular, large sample properties are the same unless the prior is degenerate. For small samples and as far as the final recommended dose level is concerned, simulations indicate that there is not much to choose between a likelihood approach and a Bayesian one. However, for in-trial allocation of dose levels to patients, there are some differences and these are discussed. In contrast to the Bayesian approach, a likelihood one requires some extra effort to get off the ground. This is because the likelihood equation has no solution until we observe a toxicity. Initially then we suggest working with either a standard Up-and-Down scheme or standard continual reassessment method until toxicity is observed and then switching to the new scheme.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijrobp.2018.12.043},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To identify an optimal dose for reirradiation (reRT) of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: ReRT dose levels were selected using an adaptive utility-based dose-finding method. The coprimary endpoints were toxicity (mild, moderate, high, or severe) and efficacy, evaluated 1 month after reRT. Efficacy was defined as improvements in imaging, clinical status, and quality of life. Secondary endpoints were progression-free and overall survival. Utility of each dose level was calculated based on a combined toxicity/efficacy score, ranging from 0 for (severe toxicity, no efficacy) to 100 for (mild toxicity, all 3 efficacy improvements).
RESULTS: Twelve patients completed reRT at 3 dose levels: 24 Gy in 12 fractions (6 patients), 26.4 Gy in 12 fractions (4 patients), and 30.8 Gy in 14 fractions (2 patients). One patient treated at dose level 3 developed a grade 3 acute toxicity. Five of the 6 patients receiving 24 Gy demonstrated improvement in 2 of 3 efficacy domains, and the sixth demonstrated improvement in all efficacy domains. Of 4 patients receiving 26.4 Gy, 1 demonstrated no improvement, and 1 patient each demonstrated improvement in 1, 2, and 3 efficacy domains. Of 2 patients receiving 30.8 Gy, 1 demonstrated improvement in 3 efficacy domains, and 1 did not complete the quality of life and was not assessed. Mean utilities were 88 for dose level 1, 76 for dose level 2, and 25 for dose level 3. For all patients, the median overall survival was 19.5 months from initial diagnosis (95\% confidence interval, 15.6-21.1 months), and the median progression-free survival was 4.5 months from the start of reRT (95\% confidence interval, 2.7-6.2 months).
CONCLUSIONS: ReRT can safely be delivered for progressive diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. Clinical improvement was seen in almost all patients. Utility analysis suggests that a regimen of 24 Gy in 12 fractions is preferred.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can cause potentially useful changes in brain functional connectivity (FC), but the number of treatment sessions required is unknown. We applied the continual reassessment method (CRM), a Bayesian, adaptive, dose-finding procedure to a rTMS paradigm in an attempt to answer this question.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample size was predetermined at 15 subjects and the cohort size was set with three individuals (i.e., five total cohorts). In a series of consecutive daily sessions, we delivered rTMS to the left posterior parietal cortex and measured resting-state FC with fMRI in a predefined hippocampal network in the left hemisphere. The session number for each successive cohort was determined by the CRM algorithm. We set a response criterion of a 0.028 change in FC between the hippocampus and the parietal cortex, which was equal to the increase seen in 87.5\% of participants in a previous study using five sessions.
RESULTS: A ≥criterion change was observed in 9 of 15 participants. The CRM indicated that greater than four sessions are required to produce the criterion change reliably in future studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The CRM can be adapted for rTMS dose finding when a reliable outcome measure, such as FC, is available. The minimum effective dose needed to produce a criterion increase in FC in our hippocampal network of interest at 87.5\% efficacy was estimated to be greater than four sessions. This study is the first demonstration of a Bayesian, adaptive method to explore a rTMS parameter.},

	abstract = {This brief review provides a practical guide for drug combination studies and delineates its essence in terms of the mass-action-based theory, experimental design and automated computerised data analysis. The combination index (CI) method of Chou-Talalay is based on the multiple drug effect equation derived from the median-effect principle of the mass-action law. It provides quantitative determination for synergism (CI {\textless} 1), additive effect (CI = 1) and antagonism (CI {\textgreater} 1), and provides the algorithm for computer software for automated simulation for drug combinations. It takes into account both the potency (the D(m) value) and the shape of the dose-effect curve (the m value) of each drug alone and their combination. The best feature is that it allows for small size experiments. The automated computer simulation reveals whether there is a synergism, determines how much synergism (the CI value) at any effect levels (the F(a)-CI plot), or at any dose levels (the isobologram), provides the information regarding how many folds of dose-reduction is allowed for each drug, at a given effect for a synergistic combination, comparing with the dose required for each drug alone (the F(a)-DRI plot), and the optimal combination ratio and schedule dependency for synergy. The 'polygonogram' dissects the component drug interactions or projects the make-ups of cocktails in complicated combinations. Based on scientific, practical and ethical reasons, it is not possible to 'determine' synergism in humans, and thus prior to the drug combination clinical trials, preclinical drug combination studies in vitro and/or in animals should be carried out to obtain the basis and rationale for studies in humans.},

The secondary aims were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of TPI 287 and the treatment responses.
PROCEDURE: Eighteen patients were enrolled to a phase I dose escalation trial of weekly intravenous infusion of TPI 287 for two 28-day cycles with toxicity monitoring to determine the MTD, followed by two cycles of TPI 287 in combination with TMZ. Samples were collected to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters C(max), AUC(0-24), t(1/2), CL, and Vd on day 1 of cycles 1 (TPI 287 alone) and 3 (TPI 287 + TMZ) following TPI 287 infusion. Treatment response was evaluated by radiographic (CT or MRI) and radionuclide (MIBG) imaging for neuroblastoma.
RESULTS: We determined the MTD of TPI 287 alone and in combination with temozolomide to be 125 mg/m(2). The non-dose-limiting toxicities at this dose were mainly anorexia and pain. The dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of two patients at 135 mg/m(2) were grade 3 hemorrhagic cystitis and grade 3 sensory neuropathy.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, TPI 287 was well tolerated by pediatric patients with refractory and relapsed neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma at a dose of 125 mg/m(2) IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 day cycle.},

Patients with stage IV unresectable or recurrent stage III melanoma were eligible. Stable untreated or treated brain metastases were allowed. Patients with previous taxane exposure were excluded. TPI 287 was administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 and temozolomide was taken orally daily on days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle. Responses were assessed every two cycles according to WHO criteria.

The dose-limiting toxicity was neuropathy and six patients experienced grade III neuropathy. All patients were evaluable for tumor response. There were no complete responses; there were two partial responses and seven patients had stable disease (overall response rate 9.5\% and disease control rate 42.9\%). Three patients had stable disease in the brain despite progressive extracranial disease.

The advent of HER2-directed therapy resulted in greatly improved survival outcomes, but unfortunately at the price of an increased cumulative incidence of BCBM. We review challenges in the management of BCBM, and potential treatment strategies, including novel agents such as poly-adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (olaparib, veliparib), cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors (palbociclib, abemaciclib), and taxane derivatives (eg, ANG1005 and TPI-287). The utility of human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-directed therapies-lapatinib, ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), neratinib and tucatinib-is also being studied in this setting. We address the need for improved imaging techniques and innovation in clinical trial design. For example, the current practice is to initially administer whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) as treatment for patients with multiple BCBM. However, in selected circumstances, first-line systemic treatment may be more appropriate in order to avoid neurocognitive toxicities, and potential options should be evaluated in window of opportunity trials. Other strategies that may aid development of more effective clinical trials and expedite the development of promising agents include the use of different clinical endpoints and different imaging tools.},

	abstract = {Microtubules play a crucial role in maintaining the shape and function of neurons. During progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), severe destabilization of microtubules occurs, which leads to the permanent disruption of signal transduction processes and memory loss. Thus, microtubule stabilization is one of the key requirements for the treatment of AD. Taxol, a microtubule stabilizing anticancer drug, has been considered as a potential anti-AD drug but was never tested in AD patients, likely because of its' toxic nature and poor brain exposure. However, other microtubule-targeting agents such as epothilone D (BMS-241027) and TPI-287 (abeotaxane) and NAP peptide (davunetide) have entered in AD clinical programs. Therefore, the taxol binding pocket of tubulin could be a potential site for designing of mild and noncytotoxic microtubule stabilizing molecules. Here, we adopted an innovative strategy for the development of a peptide based microtubule stabilizer, considering the taxol binding pocket of β-tubulin, by using alanine scanning mutagenesis technique. This approach lead us to a potential octapeptide, which strongly binds to the taxol pocket of β-tubulin, serves as an excellent microtubule stabilizer, increases the expression of acetylated tubulin, and acts as an Aβ aggregation inhibitor and neuroprotective agent. Further, results revealed that this peptide is nontoxic against both PC12 derived neurons and primary cortical neurons. We believe that our strategy and discovery of peptide-based microtubule stabilizer will open the door for the development of potential anti-AD therapeutics in near future.},

The AURKA inhibitor alisertib exhibits antiproliferative activity against glioblastoma in vitro and in vivo. Unlike current clinically used taxane drugs, the novel taxane TPI 287 penetrates the CNS. We tested for interactions between three selective AURKA inhibitors and TPI 287 against standard U87 and U1242 cells and primary glioblastoma neurospheres using colony formation assays. Bliss and Chou-Talalay analyses were utilized to statistically test for synergism. Morphological analysis, flow cytometry and annexin V binding were employed to examine cell cycle and apoptotic effects of these drug combinations. TPI 287 not only potentiated the cytotoxicity of the AURKA inhibitors alisertib, MLN8054 and TC-A2317, but was often potently synergistic. Morphologic and biochemical analysis of the combined effects of alisertib and TPI 287 consistently revealed synergistic induction of apoptosis. While each agent alone induces a mitotic block, slippage occurs allowing some tumor cells to avoid apoptosis. Combination treatment greatly attenuated mitotic slippage, committing the majority of cells to apoptosis. Alisertib and TPI 287 demonstrate significant synergism against glioblastoma cells largely attributable to a synergistic effect in inducing apoptosis. These results provide compelling rationale for clinical testing of alisertib and/or other AURKA inhibitors for potential combination use with TPI 287 against glioblastoma and other CNS neoplasms.},

	abstract = {Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is the main objective of phase I trials. Trials are typically carried out with restricted sample sizes. Model-based approaches proposed to identify the MTD (including the Continual Reassessment Method or CRM) suppose a simple model for the dose-toxicity relation. At this early stage of clinical development, the true family of models is not known and several proposals have been done. Asymptotic convergence of the recommendation to the true MTD can be obtained with a one-parameter model even in case of model misspecification. Nevertheless, operating characteristics with finite sample sizes can be largely affected by the choice of the model. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several models in a simulation framework. This framework includes a large class of dose-toxicity relations against which to test the competing models, an 'optimal' method that provides efficient non-parametric estimates of the probability of dose limiting toxicity to serve as a benchmark and as a graphic representation. In particular we explore the use of a one-parameter versus a two-parameter model, we compare the power and the logistic models and finally we investigate the impact of dose recoding on the operating characteristics. Comparisons are carried out with both a likelihood approach and a Bayesian approach for model estimations. We show that average performances of a one-parameter model are superior and that the power model has good operating characteristics. Some models can speed up dose escalation and lead to more aggressive designs. We derive some behavior related to the choice of model and insist on the use of simulations under several scenarios before the initiation of each new trial in order to determine the best model to be used.},

Although the likelihood function for the data arising from such a scheme is identical to one arising under a conditional binomial sampling assumption, intervals based on the exact distribution of the usual large-sample statistics under this assumption do not offer improvement over unadjusted intervals. However, consideration of the distribution of these statistics based on the true stochastic sampling scheme can lead to the construction of intervals with correct coverage probabilities that do not depend on the true values of the model parameters. Membership in the confidence set can be evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation at a restricted maximum likelihood estimate of the nuisance slope parameter, despite upward bias in its estimation from the up-and-down sampling scheme. The lack of information in the small-sample setting is reflected in a large proportion of confidence intervals that include infinite values for the MTD, especially when the dose-response curve is shallow. Intervals based on a likelihood ratio criterion perform best in this regard.},

Although there exists more or less a standard type of design for such trials, its development has been largely ad hoc. As usually implemented, the trial design has no intrinsic property that provides a generally satisfactory basis for estimation of the MTD. In this paper, the standard design and several simple alternatives are compared with regard to the conservativeness of the design and with regard to point and interval estimation of an MTD (33rd percentile) with small sample sizes. Using a Markov chain representation, we found several designs to be nearly as conservative as the standard design in terms of the proportion of patients entered at higher dose levels. In Monte Carlo simulations, two two-stage designs are found to provide reduced bias in maximum likelihood estimation of the MTD in less than ideal dose-response settings. Of the three methods considered for determining confidence intervals--the delta method, a method based on Fieller's theorem, and a likelihood ratio method--none was able to provide both usefully narrow intervals and coverage probabilities close to nominal.},

Several of the reasons it has been embraced by clinical trialists is that it tends to incur fewer toxic events, and more accurately estimate the maximum tolerated dose as compared to the standard Phase I dose escalation designs. Many variations have been published and discussed in the statistical literature, but there has not been as much practical advice for choosing design parameters and implementing the CRM. As a result, the CRM has not been as widely utilized as it could be for dose-finding studies. The goal of this paper is to provide a tutorial for those unfamiliar with the CRM who are either statisticians considering using the CRM for the first time, or investigators with some statistical background. This paper presents the original CRM, and then some of its modified versions. It also explains the specifications that define a CRM design, along with simulated examples of CRMs and standard designs, for illustration.},

	abstract = {Cancer treatments have evolved from indiscriminate cytotoxic agents to selective genome- and immune-targeted drugs that have transformed the outcomes of some malignancies1. Tumor complexity and heterogeneity suggest that the 'precision medicine' paradigm of cancer therapy requires treatment to be personalized to the individual patient2-6. To date, precision oncology trials have been based on molecular matching with predetermined monotherapies7-14. Several of these trials have been hindered by very low matching rates, often in the 5-10\% range15, and low response rates. Low matching rates may be due to the use of limited gene panels, restrictive molecular matching algorithms, lack of drug availability, or the deterioration and death of end-stage patients before therapy can be implemented. We hypothesized that personalized treatment with combination therapies would improve outcomes in patients with refractory malignancies. As a first test of this concept, we implemented a cross-institutional prospective study (I-PREDICT, NCT02534675 ) that used tumor DNA sequencing and timely recommendations for individualized treatment with combination therapies. We found that administration of customized multidrug regimens was feasible, with 49\% of consented patients receiving personalized treatment. Targeting of a larger fraction of identified molecular alterations, yielding a higher 'matching score', was correlated with significantly improved disease control rates, as well as longer progression-free and overall survival rates, compared to targeting of fewer somatic alterations. Our findings suggest that the current clinical trial paradigm for precision oncology, which pairs one driver mutation with one drug, may be optimized by treating molecularly complex and heterogeneous cancers with combinations of customized agents.},

	shorttitle = {Therapeutic misconception in research subjects},
	doi = {10.1177/1740774512456455},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Therapeutic misconception (TM), which occurs when research subjects fail to appreciate the distinction between the imperatives of clinical research and ordinary treatment, may undercut the process of obtaining meaningful consent to clinical research participation. Previous studies have found that TM is widespread, but progress in addressing TM has been stymied by the absence of a validated method for assessing its presence.
PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to develop and validate a theoretically grounded measure of TM, assess its diagnostic accuracy, and test previous findings regarding TM's prevalence.
METHODS: A total of 220 participants were recruited from clinical trials at four academic medical centers in the United States. Participants completed a 28-item Likert-type questionnaire to assess the presence of beliefs associated with TM, and a semistructured TM interview designed to elicit their perceptions of the nature of the clinical trial in which they were participating. Data from the questionnaires were subjected to factor analysis, and items with poor factor loadings were excluded. This resulted in a 10-item scale, with three strongly correlated factors and excellent internal consistency; the fit indices of the model across 10 training sets were consistent with the original results, suggesting a stable factor solution.
RESULTS: The scale was validated against the TM interview, with significantly higher scores among subjects coded as displaying evidence of TM. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis based on a 10-fold internal cross-validation yielded area under the ROC (AUC) = 0.682 for any evidence of TM. When sensitivity (0.72) and specificity (0.61) were both optimized, positive predictive value was 0.65 and negative predictive value was 0.68, with a positive likelihood ratio of 1.89 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.47. In all, 50.5\% (n = 101) of the participants manifested evidence of TM on the TM interview, a somewhat lower rate than in most previous studies.
LIMITATIONS: The predictive value of the scale compared with the 'gold standard' clinical interview is modest, although similar to other instruments based on self-report assessing states of mind rather than discrete symptoms. Thus, although the scale can offer evidence of which subjects are at risk for distortions in their decisions and to what degree, it will not allow researchers to conclude definitively that TM is present in a given subject.
CONCLUSIONS: The development of a reliable and valid TM scale, even with modest predictive power, should permit investigators in clinical trials to identify subjects with tendencies to misinterpret the nature of the situation and to provide additional information to them. It should also stimulate research on how best to decrease TM and facilitate meaningful informed consent to clinical research.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Immunotherapy has rapidly become the mainstream treatment of multiple cancer types. Since the first drug approval in 2011, we have noted a decline in referrals from inpatient oncology to hospice and an increase in referrals to subacute rehabilitation (SAR) facilities, possibly with the aim of getting strong enough for immunotherapy and other promising drugs. This study explores outcomes after discharge to SAR, including rates of cancer-directed therapy after SAR, overall survival, and hospice use.
METHODS: We performed an electronic chart review of patients discharged from our inpatient oncology units to SAR facilities from 2009 to 2017. Demographics, admission statistics, and post-discharge outcomes were gathered from discharge summaries and targeted chart searches.
RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-eight patients were referred to SAR 413 times. One hundred seventy-four patients (49\%) returned to the oncology clinic before readmission or death, and only 117 (33\%) ever received additional cancer-directed treatment (chemotherapy, radiation, or immunotherapy). Among all discharges, 28\% led to readmissions within 30 days. Seventy-four patients (21\%) were deceased within 30 days, only 31\% of whom were referred to hospice. Palliative care involvement resulted in more frequent do not resuscitate code status, documented goals of care discussions, and electronic advance directives.
CONCLUSION: A growing number of oncology inpatients are being discharged to SAR, but two thirds do not receive additional cancer therapy at any point, including a substantial fraction who are readmitted or deceased within 1 month. These data can help guide decision making and hospital discharge planning that aligns with patients' goals of care. More clinical data are needed to predict who is most likely to benefit from SAR and proceed to further cancer therapy.},

We call our study design bCRM, for bivariate CRM, which we apply to a study of bone marrow patients seeking to find the optimal time after bone marrow transplant at which to taper immune suppression and eventually begin donor leukocyte infusions. We demonstrate through simulation that bCRM has excellent operating characteristics and compare the performance of bCRM in a bone marrow transplantation study to designs proposed by previous investigators.

We propose a simple extension to the continual reassessment method (CRM), called the Quasi-CRM, to incorporate grade information. Toxicity grades are first converted to numeric scores that reflect their impacts on the dose allocation procedure, and then incorporated into the CRM using the quasi-Bernoulli likelihood. A simulation study demonstrates that the Quasi-CRM is superior to the standard CRM and comparable to a univariate version of the Bekele and Thall method (2004, Journal of the American Statistical Association 99, 26-35).

	abstract = {Adaptive, model-based, dose-finding methods, such as the continual reassessment method, have been shown to have good operating characteristics. One school of thought argues in favor of the use of parsimonious models, not modeling all aspects of the problem, and using a strict minimum number of parameters. In particular, for the standard situation of a single homogeneous group, it is common to appeal to a one-parameter model. Other authors argue for a more classical approach that models all aspects of the problem. Here, we show that increasing the dimension of the parameter space, in the context of adaptive dose-finding studies, is usually counter productive and, rather than leading to improvements in operating characteristics, the added dimensionality is likely to result in difficulties. Among these are inconsistency of parameter estimates, lack of coherence in escalation or de-escalation, erratic behavior, getting stuck at the wrong level, and, in almost all cases, poorer performance in terms of correct identification of the targeted dose. Our conclusions are based on both theoretical results and simulations. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	doi = {10.1016/S1470-2045(19)30513-3},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Checkpoint inhibitor therapy is a standard of care for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Treatment options after checkpoint inhibitor therapy include vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF-R) tyrosine kinase inhibitors, although no prospective data regarding their use in this setting exist. Axitinib is a VEGF-R inhibitor with clinical data supporting increased activity with dose titration. We aimed to investigate the activity of dose titrated axitinib in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who were previously treated with checkpoint inhibitor.
METHODS: We did a multicentre, phase 2 trial of axitinib given on an individualised dosing algorithm. Patients at least 18 years of age with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally recurrent or metastatic renal cell carcinoma with clear cell histology, a Karnofsky Performance Status of 70\% or more, and measurable disease who received checkpoint inhibitor therapy as the most recent treatment were eligible. There was no limit on number of previous therapies received. Patients received oral axitinib at a starting dose of 5 mg twice daily with dose titration every 14 days in 1 mg increments (ie, 5 mg twice daily to 6 mg twice daily, up to 10 mg twice daily maximum dose) if there was no axitinib-related grade 2 or higher mucositis, diarrhoea, hand-foot syndrome, or fatigue. If one or more of these grade 2 adverse events occurred, axitinib was withheld for 3 days before the same dose was resumed. Dose reductions were made if recurrent grade 2 adverse events despite treatment breaks or grade 3-4 adverse events occurred. The primary outcome was progression-free survival. Analyses were done per protocol in all patients who received at least one dose of axitinib. Recruitment has been completed and the trial is ongoing. This trial is registered with ClincalTrials.gov, number NCT02579811.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 5, 2016 and Feb 21, 2018, 40 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of study treatment. With a median follow-up of 8·7 months (IQR 3·7-14·2), the median progression-free survival was 8·8 months (95\% CI 5·7-16·6). Fatigue (83\%) and hypertension (75\%) were the most common all-grade adverse events. The most common grade 3 adverse event was hypertension (24 patients [60\%]). There was one (3\%) grade 4 adverse event (elevated lipase) and no treatment-related deaths occurred. Serious adverse events that were likely related to therapy occurred in eight (20\%) patients; the most common were dehydration (n=4) and diarrhoea (n=2).
INTERPRETATION: Individualised axitinib dosing in patients with metastatic renal cell inoma previously treated with checkpoint inhibitors did not meet the prespecified threshold for progression free survival, but these data show that this individualised titration scheme is feasible and has robust clinical activity. These prospective results warrant consideration of axitinib in this setting.

The second design is for a dose-finding trial of natural killer cells to treat advanced hematologic malignancies, with five time-to-event outcomes. Each design is based on a Bayesian hierarchical model that borrows strength between subgroups. Computer simulation is used to evaluate each design's properties, including comparison to a simpler design ignoring treatment-subgroup interactions. The simulations show that accounting prospectively for treatment-subgroup interactions yields designs with very desirable properties, is greatly superior to a simplified comparator design that ignores subgroups if treatment-subgroup interactions actually exist, and each design is robust to deviations from the assumed underlying model.},

	issn = {1740-7753},
	doi = {10.1177/1740774519873316},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This article studies the notion of irrational dose assignment in Phase I clinical trials. This property was recently defined by Zhou and colleagues as a dose assignment that fails to de-escalate the dose when two out of three, three out of six, or four out of six patients have experienced a dose-limiting toxicity event at the current dose level. The authors claimed that a drawback of the well-known continual reassessment method is that it can result in irrational dose assignments. The aim of this article is to examine this definition of irrationality more closely within the conduct of the continual reassessment method.
METHODS: Over a broad range of assumed dose-limiting toxicity probability scenarios for six study dose levels and a variety of target dose-limiting toxicity rates, we simulated 2000 trials of n = 36 patients. For each scenario, we counted the number of irrational dose assignments that were made by the continual reassessment method, according to the definitions of Zhou and colleagues. For each of the irrational decisions made, we classified the dose assignment as an underdose assignment, a target dose assignment, or an overdose assignment based on the true dose-limiting toxicity probability at that dose.
RESULTS: Across eight dose-toxicity scenarios, there were a total of 181,581 dose assignments made in the simulation study. Of these assignments, 8165 (4.5\%) decisions were made when two out of three, three out of six, or four out of six patients had experienced a dose-limiting toxicity at the current dose. Of these 8165 decisions, 1505 (18.4\%) recommended staying at the current dose level and would therefore be classified as irrational by Zhou and colleagues. Among the irrational decisions, 41.2\% were misclassified, meaning they were made either at the true target dose (17.9\%) or at a true underdose (23.3\%). The remaining 58.8\% were made at a true overdose and therefore truly irrational. Overall, irrational dose assignments comprised {\textless}1\% of the total dose assignments made during the simulation study. Similar findings are reported in simulations across 100 randomly generated dose-toxicity scenarios from a recently proposed family of curves.
CONCLUSION: Zhou and colleagues argue that the behavior of the continual reassessment method is disturbing due to its ability to make irrational dose assignments. These definitions are based on rules that mimic the popular 3 + 3 design, which should not be the benchmark used to construct guidelines for trial conduct of modern Phase I methods. Our study illustrates that these dose assignments occur very seldom in the continual reassessment method and that even when they do occur, they can often be considered sensible when accounting for all accumulated data in the study.},

Resistance mechanisms to BRAF inhibitors can include platelet-derived growth factor-? upregulation. Dabrafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, and pazopanib, a multikinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, have not been combined previously. This phase I study was designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the combination.Patients and MethodsPatients with any advanced BRAF mutated malignancy with adequate organ function were eligible. Prior use of dabrafenib or pazopanib was not allowed. Dosages started at dabrafenib 50 mg twice a day and pazopanib 400 mg daily on dose level (DL) 1, with maximum dosages of 150 mg twice a day and 800 mg daily on DL5. Pharmacokinetics and BRAF V600E plasma clone were measured, and efficacy was evaluated by imaging and tumor markers every 8 weeks.ResultsTwenty-three patients with 11 different tumor histologies were enrolled in five DLs. Two dose-limiting toxicities were observed?a grade 3 bowel perforation on DL3 and grade 3 arthralgia on DL5. Common drug-related adverse events included nausea (52\%), skin papules (43\%), diarrhea (39\%), hand-foot syndrome (30\%), anemia (26\%), rash (22\%), vomiting (22\%), hypophosphatemia (22\%), and transaminitis (22\%). Five patients (22\%) experienced a partial response, including low-grade ovarian serous carcinoma, thyroid cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme, and two patients (appendiceal and thyroid cancer) had stable disease {\textgreater} 6 months. Pharmacokinetic measurements revealed pazopanib levels {\textless} 17.5 ?g/mL in 80\% of treated patients at steady state, particularly at DL5. BRAF V600E plasma copies correlated with response and progression.ConclusionCombination dabrafenib and pazopanib had no unexpected toxicities, and durable partial responses were observed at DL3 or greater. Dose escalation beyond DL5 may be considered as pazopanib levels were suboptimal as a result of drug interaction with dabrafenib.},

Based on these algorithms, computer software has been developed to allow automated simulation of synergism and antagonism at all dose or effect levels. It displays the dose-effect curve, median-effect plot, combination index plot, isobologram, dose-reduction index plot, and polygonogram for in vitro or in vivo studies. This theoretical development, experimental design, and computerized data analysis have facilitated dose-effect analysis for single drug evaluation or carcinogen and radiation risk assessment, as well as for drug or other entity combinations in a vast field of disciplines of biomedical sciences. In this review, selected examples of applications are given, and step-by-step examples of experimental designs and real data analysis are also illustrated. The merging of the mass-action law principle with mathematical induction-deduction has been proven to be a unique and effective scientific method for general theory development. The median-effect principle and its mass-action law based computer software are gaining increased applications in biomedical sciences, from how to effectively evaluate a single compound or entity to how to beneficially use multiple drugs or modalities in combination therapies.},

To address this, we present a mathematical model that predicts the effects of three or more antibiotics or anticancer drugs at all doses based only on measurements of drug pairs at a few doses, without need for mechanistic information. The model provides accurate predictions on available data for antibiotic combinations, and on experiments presented here on the response matrix of three cancer drugs at eight doses per drug. This approach offers a way to search for effective multidrug combinations using a small number of experiments.},

	doi = {10.1016/0065-2571(84)90007-4},
	abstract = {A generalized method for analyzing the effects of multiple drugs and for determining summation, synergism and antagonism has been proposed. The derived, generalized equations are based on kinetic principles. The method is relatively simple and is not limited by whether the dose-effect relationships are hyperbolic or sigmoidal, whether the effects of the drugs are mutually exclusive or nonexclusive, whether the ligand interactions are competitive, noncompetitive or uncompetitive, whether the drugs are agonists or antagonists, or the number of drugs involved. The equations for the two most widely used methods for analyzing synergism, antagonism and summation of effects of multiple drugs, the isobologram and fractional product concepts, have been derived and been shown to have limitations in their applications. These two methods cannot be used indiscriminately. The equations underlying these two methods can be derived from a more generalized equation previously developed by us (59). It can be shown that the isobologram is valid only for drugs whose effects are mutually exclusive, whereas the fractional product method is valid only for mutually nonexclusive drugs which have hyperbolic dose-effect curves. Furthermore, in the isobol method, it is laborious to find proper combinations of drugs that would produce an iso-effective curve, and the fractional product method tends to give indication of synergism, since it underestimates the summation of the effect of mutually nonexclusive drugs that have sigmoidal dose-effect curves. The method described herein is devoid of these deficiencies and limitations. The simplified experimental design proposed for multiple drug-effect analysis has the following advantages: It provides a simple diagnostic plot (i.e., the median-effect plot) for evaluating the applicability of the data, and provides parameters that can be directly used to obtain a general equation for the dose-effect relation; the analysis which involves logarithmic conversion and linear regression can be readily carried out with a simple programmable electronic calculator and does not require special graph paper or tables; and the simplicity of the equation allows flexibility of application and the use of a minimum number of data points. This method has been used to analyze experimental data obtained from enzymatic, cellular and animal systems.},

	abstract = {Brain metastases of breast and other cancers remain resistant to chemotherapeutic regimens that are effective systemically, in part due to the blood-brain barrier. We report that TPI-287, a new microtubule-stabilizing agent, displays in vitro cytotoxic activity similar to taxanes and epothilones. Unlike the taxanes, TPI-287 is permeable through the blood-brain barrier. Brain-to-plasma ratios of TPI-287 after a single injection typically exceeded one and were as high as 63.8 in the rat and 14.1 in the mouse. A brain-tropic derivative of the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cell line, 231-BR, was used to test whether TPI-287 may be efficacious at preventing or treating brain metastases. TPI-287 had growth inhibitory effects comparable with paclitaxel when 231-BR tumor cells were injected into the mammary fat pad. Brain metastatic colonization was determined by intracardiac injection of 231-BR cells, with treatment beginning on day 3 to 4 postinjection, culminating in a histologic count of brain metastases in brains necropsied days 25 to 28 postinjection. In this assay, paclitaxel, ixabepilone, and nab paclitaxel did not have significant inhibitory activity. TPI-287 was ineffective in the same assay using a 6 mg/kg every week schedule; however an 18 mg/kg dose delivered on days 3, 7, and 11 significantly reduced the outgrowth of brain metastases (55\% reduction, P = 0.028) and reduced proliferation in brain metastases (16\% reduction, P = 0.008). When TPI-287 treatment was delayed until days 18, 22, and 26 postinjection, efficacy was reduced (17\% reduction, not significant). These data suggest that TPI-287 may have efficacy when administered early in the course of the disease.},

Based on the synergism between histone deacetylase inhibitors and hypomethylating agents that we established in preclinical PTCL models, we conducted a phase 1 study of oral 5-azacytidine (AZA) and romidepsin (ROMI) in patients with advanced lymphoid malignancies, with emphasis on PTCL. According to a 3 + 3 design, patients were assigned to 1 of 7 cohorts with AZA doses ranging from 100 mg daily on days 1 to 14 to 300 mg daily on days 1 to 21, ROMI doses ranging from 10 mg/m2 on days 8 and 15 to 14 mg/m2 on days 8, 15, and 22, with cycles of 21 to 35 days. Coprimary end points included maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). We treated a total of 31 patients. The MTD was AZA 300 mg on days 1 to 14 and ROMI 14 mg/m2 on days 8, 15, and 22 on a 35-day cycle. DLTs included grade 4 thrombocytopenia, prolonged grade 3 thrombocytopenia, grade 4 neutropenia, and pleural effusion. There were no treatment-related deaths. The combination was substantially more active in patients with PTCL than in those with non-T-cell lymphoma. The overall response rate in all, non-T-cell, and T-cell lymphoma patients was 32\%, 10\%, and 73\%, respectively, and the complete response rates were 23\%, 5\%, and 55\%, respectively. We did not find an association between response and level of demethylation or tumor mutational profile. This study establishes that combined epigenetic modifiers are potently active in PTCL patients.

	abstract = {Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has shown promise in the treatment of haematological cancers and is currently being investigated for solid tumours, including high-grade glioma brain tumours. There is a desperate need to quantitatively study the factors that contribute to the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy in solid tumours. In this work, we use a mathematical model of predator-prey dynamics to explore the kinetics of CAR T-cell killing in glioma: the Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell treatment Response in GliOma (CARRGO) model. The model includes rates of cancer cell proliferation, CAR T-cell killing, proliferation, exhaustion, and persistence. We use patient-derived and engineered cancer cell lines with an in vitro real-time cell analyser to parametrize the CARRGO model. We observe that CAR T-cell dose correlates inversely with the killing rate and correlates directly with the net rate of proliferation and exhaustion. This suggests that at a lower dose of CAR T-cells, individual T-cells kill more cancer cells but become more exhausted when compared with higher doses. Furthermore, the exhaustion rate was observed to increase significantly with tumour growth rate and was dependent on level of antigen expression. The CARRGO model highlights nonlinear dynamics involved in CAR T-cell therapy and provides novel insights into the kinetics of CAR T-cell killing. The model suggests that CAR T-cell treatment may be tailored to individual tumour characteristics including tumour growth rate and antigen level to maximize therapeutic benefit.},

	abstract = {Purpose: CPI-613, a lipoate analogue that inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and α-ketogluterate dehydrogenase (KGDH), has activity in patients with myeloid malignancies. This study explored the role of mitochondrial metabolism in chemotherapy response and determined the MTD, efficacy, and safety of CPI-613 combined with high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.Experimental Design: The role of mitochondrial response to chemotherapy was assessed in cell lines and animal models. A phase I study of CPI-613 plus cytarabine and mitoxantrone was conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory AML.Results: Exposure to chemotherapy induced mitochondrial oxygen consumption that depended on PDH. CPI-613 sensitized AML cells to chemotherapy indicating that mitochondrial metabolism is a source of resistance. Loss of p53 did not alter response to CPI-613. The phase I study enrolled 67 patients and 62 were evaluable for response. The overall response rate was 50\% (26CR+5CRi/62). Median survival was 6.7 months. In patients over 60 years old, the CR/CRi rate was 47\% (15/32) with a median survival of 6.9 months. The response rate for patients with poor-risk cytogenetics also was encouraging with 46\% (11/24 patients) achieving a CR or CRi. RNA sequencing analysis of a subset of baseline bone marrow samples revealed a gene expression signature consistent with the presence of B cells in the pretreatment marrow of responders.Conclusions: The addition of CPI-613 to chemotherapy is a promising approach in older patients and those with poor-risk cytogenetics.

Methods: A total of 12 treatment-naive patients (aged 18-65 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status [ECOG PS] ≤1) with MPC received 5-fluorouracil 180 mg/m2 per day (days 1-14 continuous infusion); nab-paclitaxel 75 mg/m2, leucovorin 20 mg/m2, and oxaliplatin 40 mg/m2 (days 1, 8, and 15); and bevacizumab 5 mg/kg (days 1 and 15) administered intravenously in each 28-day cycle. The primary end-point was incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in cycle 1. Safety was further evaluated as a secondary end-point; preliminary efficacy was also examined. Results: Two DLTs (grade 3 anemia requiring transfusion and grade 3 mucositis unresponsive to treatment within 4 days of onset) were observed in one of six patients enrolled in dose cohort 1. Cohort 1 was expanded from 6 to 12 patients to further evaluate safety, per the investigators' recommendation. All patients discontinued treatment. The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were abdominal pain, fatigue, mucositis, and decreased neutrophil count. Objective response rate was 33\% (four partial responses). Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 5.6 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-11.3) and 9.9 (95\% CI, 4.4-13.2) months, respectively; 1-year PFS and OS rates were 12.2\% (95\% CI, 0.7-40.8) and 38.9\% (95\% CI, 12.6-65.0). Conclusion: FABLOx is feasible and tolerable in patients newly diagnosed with MPC. However, preliminary efficacy data are inconclusive for continued investigation in a phase II trial.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: 
Even after a decade of great advances for Bayesian adaptive design and model-based dose-finding, oncology dose-finding studies continue to pursue the mirage of ‘the’ maximum tolerated dose (MTD). This fallacious, anti-precision concept maintains a pretext for one-size-fits-all dosing that ignores the long-recognized heterogeneity of cancer patients’ pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), as well as the equally important  diversity of their individual values and goals of care. Under this conceptual yoke, these dose-finding studies constitute a significant choke-point in drug development, where a severe discount may be applied to the potential value in new molecules through the hobbling of subsequent efficacy trials by inadequate individual-level dosing.

DOSE TITRATION ALGORITHM TUNING:
Dose Titration Algorithm Tuning (DTAT), a new methodologic advance [1], shows we can reconceive the aim of early-phase drug studies, not as ‘dose-finding’, but now as dose titration algorithm (DTA)-finding. This new conception lets us see through the mirage of ‘the’ MTD, to a properly individualized notion of MTDi.

IMPACT ON PATIENTS \& INNOVATION:
A large body of literature stretching back 2 decades ([2–4], inter alia) shows that patients who have adverse effects (such as neutropenia) from their chemotherapy also have better outcomes from treatment. DTAT allows safe titration to each individual patient’s maximum tolerated dose, so that each patient gets his or her best chance of achieving a remission. This, in turn, gives each investigational new drug (IND) the best chance to succeed in Phase 2 and 3 efficacy trials.

BEYOND THE CYTOTOXICS:
In the important area of immuno-oncology, common dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) admit monitoring on time-scales comparable to the chemotherapy induced neutropenia (CIN) simulated in [1]. The cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that accompanies CAR-T therapies, for example, typically arises within 1 week of administration (even earlier with concomitant high-dose IL-2) and constitutes a clinical syndrome that admits multivariate monitoring on numerous quantitative clinical and laboratory measures. Even molecularly targeted agents (MTAs), for which late toxicities have attracted the lion’s share of attention, remain accessible to the DTAT principle—with DTA learning simply occurring on a longer time scale.

WHAT DTAT MEANS TO YOU:
DTAT presents a prima facie case for discarding the outmoded concept of ‘the’ maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cancer therapeutics. The DTAT principle should be of interest to a wide range of stakeholders, from cancer patients with a stake in receiving optimal individualized ‘MTDi’ dosing, to shareholders in pharmaceutical innovation with a stake in efficient dose-finding before Phase III trials.

	abstract = {Background: I have previously evaluated the efficiency of one-size-fits-all dosing for single agents in oncology (Norris 2017b). By means of a generic argument based on an Emax-type dose-response model, I showed that one-size-fits-all dosing may roughly halve a drug's value to society. Since much of the past decade's 'innovation' in oncology dose-finding methodology has involved the development of special methods for combination therapies, a generalization of my earlier investigations to combination dosing seems called-for. Methods: Fundamental to my earlier work was the premise that optimal dose is a characteristic of each individual patient, distributed across the population like any other physiologic characteristic such as height. I generalize that principle here to the 2-dimensional setting of combination dosing with drugs A and B, using a copula to build a bivariate joint distribution of (MTDi,A, MTDi,B) from single-agent marginal densities of MTDi,A and MTDi,B, and interpolating 'toxicity isocontours' in the (a, b)-plane between the respective monotherapy intercepts. Within this framework, three distinct notional toxicities are elaborated: one specific to drug A, a second specific to drug B, and a third 'nonspecific' toxicity clinically attributable to either drug. The dose-response model of (Norris 2017b) is also generalized to this 2-D scenario, with the addition of an interaction term to provide for a complementary effect from combination dosing. A population of 1,000 patients is simulated, and used as a basis to evaluate population-level efficacy of two pragmatic dose-finding designs: a dose-titration method that maximizes dose-intensity subject to tolerability, and the well-known POCRM method for 1-size-fits-all combination-dose finding. Hypothetical 'oracular' methods are also evaluated, to define theoretical upper limits of performance for individualized and 1-size-fits-all dosing respectively. Results: In our simulation, pragmatic titration attains 89\% efficiency relative to theoretically optimal individualized dosing, whereas POCRM attains only 55\% efficiency. The passage from oracular individualized dosing to oracular 1-size-fits-all dosing incurs an efficiency loss of 33\%, while the parallel passage (within the 'pragmatic' realm) from titration to POCRM incurs a loss of 38\%. Conclusions: In light of the 33\% figure above, the greater part of POCRM's 38\% efficiency loss relative to titration appears attributable to POCRM's 1-size-fits-all nature, rather than to any pragmatic difficulties it confronts. Thus, appeals to pragmatic considerations would seem neither to justify the decision to use 1-size-fits-all dose-finding designs, nor to excuse their inefficiencies.},

            Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a remarkably effective immunotherapy that relies on
            in vivo
            expansion of engineered CAR T cells (after lymphodepletion by chemotherapy) to overcome the patient’s tumor burden. The quantitative laws underlying this expansion and subsequent eradication of tumors remain unknown. Still, about 60\% of CAR T-treated patients are likely to progress; their tumors are not eradicated. There is a critical need to understand and disentangle the multiple processes that contribute to CAR expansion and tumor eradication. Our goal is a quantitative understanding and ranking of the sources of variability that determine tumor response and the ultimate success of CAR T cell therapy. We here develop a mathematical model of T cell-tumor cell co-evolution, and demonstrate that CAR T cell expansion is shaped by immune reconstitution, antigen load, and cytokine signaling after lymphodepletion. We find that success of therapy is a stochastic event. Even if durable response is highly likely, its timing can be highly variable. As a consequence, we predict that clinical interventions to decrease tumor mass before CAR T could improve likelihood and timing of durable response. Changing the composition of the CAR population toward more memory cells could also improve survival, but we predict that there are diminishing returns for such efforts. All together, we provide a cell population-based approach to model and understand CAR T cell therapy, which can be leveraged to suggest new dosing strategies, and assess the need for multiple doses and their outcomes.},

The study consists of two parts; an initial phase evaluating the safety of the combination in participants with metastatic breast cancer, followed by a second phase assessing the safety of the combination in participants with residual disease after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. We describe the adaptation of a model-based design for identifying the maximum tolerated dose combination that efficiently moves from the initial phase in an advanced disease population to the second phase in the target population. Operating characteristics demonstrate the ability of the method to accurately predict true maximum tolerated dose combinations in a high percentage of trials with reasonable sample sizes, while treating participants at and around desirable combinations. The proposed design is a practical, early-phase, adaptive method for use with drug combination dose finding in the presence of shifting patient populations. More challenging research questions are being investigated in early-phase trials, which has created the need to implement more flexible designs that can meet the objectives of current studies, such as those exploring drug combinations while addressing patient heterogeneity.

	abstract = {Abstract Introduction Immune-related adverse event (IRAE) onset may represent a clinical biomarker for anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody response based on emerging evidence from patients with various advanced malignancies. This phenomenon has not been previously reported in a multidisease cohort of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer with Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications to receive immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Materials and Methods The study was a multicenter retrospective cohort analysis of 76 patients with GI cancer who had received anti-PD-1 antibodies for FDA-approved indications. The primary and secondary outcomes of the study were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients based upon IRAE presence, respectively. PFS and OS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method; a Cox proportional-hazards model adjusted for IRAE onset, patient age, and enrolling institution was used to analyze outcomes. Results Median PFS and OS were prolonged in patients who experienced IRAEs compared with those who did not experience them (PFS: not reached [NR] vs. 3.9 months [hazard ratio (HR) 0.13, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.05?0.3, p {\textless} .001]; OS: NR vs. 7.4 months [HR 0.11, 95\% CI 0.03?0.36, p {\textless} .001]). Among patients who experienced IRAEs, there were no significant differences in PFS and OS by either initial IRAE severity, management, or time to onset. Conclusion Patients with gastrointestinal cancer who experienced IRAEs while on anti-PD-1 antibodies demonstrated significant improvements in PFS and OS compared with their counterparts who did not develop IRAEs. Although these findings add to results from studies in other tumor types, larger prospective studies are needed prior to clinical adoption of IRAE onset as a biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor response. Implications for Practice Predictive clinical biomarkers for immune checkpoint inhibitor response have been understudied in the field of immuno-oncology. Immune-related adverse event onset appears to be one such biomarker. Across tumor types, immune-related adverse event onset has been associated with response to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies. The results of this study demonstrate this for the first time in patients with gastrointestinal cancer receiving anti-PD-1 antibodies. Before immune-related adverse event onset can be adopted clinically as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor response, however, larger prospective studies are needed to better understand the nuances between immune-related adverse event characteristics (severity, site, management, timing of onset) and immune checkpoint inhibitor effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Background/aims:
              Dose-escalation studies are essential in the early stages of developing novel treatments, when the aim is to find a safe dose for administration in humans. Despite their great importance, many dose-escalation studies use study designs based on heuristic algorithms with well-documented drawbacks. Bayesian decision procedures provide a design alternative that is conceptually simple and methodologically sound, but very rarely used in practice, at least in part due to their perceived statistical complexity. There are currently very few easily accessible software implementations that would facilitate their application.
            
            
              Methods:
              We have created MoDEsT, a free and easy-to-use web application for designing and conducting single-agent dose-escalation studies with a binary toxicity endpoint, where the objective is to estimate the maximum tolerated dose. MoDEsT uses a well-established Bayesian decision procedure based on logistic regression. The software has a user-friendly point-and-click interface, makes changes visible in real time, and automatically generates a range of graphs, tables, and reports. It is aimed at clinicians as well as statisticians with limited expertise in model-based dose-escalation designs, and does not require any statistical programming skills to evaluate the operating characteristics of, or implement, the Bayesian dose-escalation design.
            
            
              Results:
              MoDEsT comes in two parts: a ‘Design’ module to explore design options and simulate their operating characteristics, and a ‘Conduct’ module to guide the dose-finding process throughout the study. We illustrate the practical use of both modules with data from a real phase I study in terminal cancer.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              Enabling both methodologists and clinicians to understand and apply model-based study designs with ease is a key factor towards their routine use in early-phase studies. We hope that MoDEsT will enable incorporation of Bayesian decision procedures for dose escalation at the earliest stage of clinical trial design, thus increasing their use in early-phase trials.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Because a dose-response relationship is characteristic of conventional chemotherapy, this concept is widely used for the development of novel cytotoxic (CTX) drugs. However, the need to reach the MTD to obtain optimal benefit with molecularly targeted agents (MTA) is controversial. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between dose and efficacy in a large cohort of phase I patients with solid tumors.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We collected data on 1,182 consecutive patients treated in phase I trials in 14 European institutions in 2005-2007. Inclusion criteria were: (i) patients treated within completed single-agent studies in which a maximum-administered dose was defined and (ii) RECIST/survival data available.
RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of patients were included in trials with MTA (N = 854) and 28\% in trials with CTX (N = 328). The objective response (OR) rate was 3\% and disease control at 6 months was 11\%. OR for CTX was associated with higher doses (median 92\% of MTD); this was not the case for MTA, where patients achieving OR received a median of 50\% of MTD. For trials with MTA, patients treated at intermediate doses (40\%-80\%) had better survival compared with those receiving low or high doses (P = 0.038). On the contrary, there was a direct association between higher dose and better OS for CTX agents (P = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: Although these results support the development of novel CTX based on MTD, we found no direct relationship between higher doses and response with MTA in unselected patients. However, the longest OS was seen in patients treated with MTA at intermediate doses (40\%-80\% of MTD).},

	abstract = {This paper studies the notion of coherence in interval-based dose-finding methods. An incoherent decision is either (a) a recommendation to escalate the dose following an observed dose-limiting toxicity or (b) a recommendation to deescalate the dose following a non-dose-limiting toxicity. In a simulated example, we illustrate that the Bayesian optimal interval method and the Keyboard method are not coherent. We generated dose-limiting toxicity outcomes under an assumed set of true probabilities for a trial of n=36 patients in cohorts of size 1, and we counted the number of incoherent dosing decisions that were made throughout this simulated trial. Each of the methods studied resulted in 13/36 (36\%) incoherent decisions in the simulated trial. Additionally, for two different target dose-limiting toxicity rates, 20\% and 30\%, and a sample size of n=30 patients, we randomly generated 100 dose-toxicity curves and tabulated the number of incoherent decisions made by each method in 1000 simulated trials under each curve. For each method studied, the probability of incurring at least one incoherent decision during the conduct of a single trial is greater than 75\%. Coherency is an important principle in the conduct of dose-finding trials. Interval-based methods violate this principle for cohorts of size 1 and require additional modifications to overcome this shortcoming. Researchers need to take a closer look at the dose assignment behavior of interval-based methods when using them to plan dose-finding studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The continual reassessment method (CRM) requires an underlying model of the dose-toxicity relationship ("prior skeleton") and there is limited guidance of what this should be when little is known about this association. In this manuscript the impact of applying the CRM with different prior skeleton approaches and the 3 + 3 method are compared in terms of ability to determine the true maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and number of patients allocated to sub-optimal and toxic doses.
METHODS: Post-hoc dose-escalation analyses on real-life clinical trial data on an early oncology compound (AZD3514), using the 3 + 3 method and CRM using six different prior skeleton approaches.
RESULTS: All methods correctly identified the true MTD. The 3 + 3 method allocated six patients to both sub-optimal and toxic doses. All CRM approaches allocated four patients to sub-optimal doses. No patients were allocated to toxic doses from sigmoidal, two from conservative and five from other approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: Prior skeletons for the CRM for phase 1 clinical trials are proposed in this manuscript and applied to a real clinical trial dataset. Highly accurate initial skeleton estimates may not be essential to determine the true MTD, and, as expected, all CRM methods out-performed the 3 + 3 method. There were differences in performance between skeletons. The choice of skeleton should depend on whether minimizing the number of patients allocated to suboptimal or toxic doses is more important.

This approval was based on the results of 2 large randomized phase III trials that enrolled patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis and compared ruxolitinib with placebo (study 1) or best available therapy (study 2). The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who experienced a reduction in spleen volume of ≥ 35\% at 24 weeks (study 1) or 48 weeks (study 2). The key secondary endpoint in study 1 was the proportion of patients who experienced a ≥ 50\% improvement from baseline in myelofibrosis total symptom score at 24 weeks. The results of these studies showed that a greater proportion of patients treated with ruxolitinib experienced a ≥ 35\% reduction in spleen volume as compared with those treated with placebo (42\% vs. 1\%, P {\textless} 0.0001) or best available therapy (29\% vs. 0\%, P {\textless} 0.0001). A greater proportion of patients in study 1 experienced a ≥ 50\% reduction in the myelofibrosis total symptom score during treatment with ruxolitinib than with placebo (46\% vs. 5\%, P {\textless} 0.0001). Ruxolitinib treatment was associated with an increased incidence of grades III and IV anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. This is the first drug approved for myelofibrosis.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with previously untreated SCCHN were enrolled. FU cohorts were 700, 850, and 1,000 mg/m(2)/d for 4 days via continuous infusion. TPF given every 3 weeks for three cycles and C was given weekly for a total of 9 weeks, starting on day 1 of TPF. All patients received chemoradiotherapy after C-TPF.
RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were enrolled and 28 were assessable. The median age was 57 years, 92\% had stage 4 disease, 71\% were oropharynx, and 100\% had a performance status of 0. No dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was encountered on dose levels 1 and 2. At dose level 3 of 1000 mg/m(2), one DLT was encountered and three more patients were enrolled with no DLTs. In the expansion cohort at the MTD, three DLT's were encountered. The decision was made to decrease the FU from 1,000 mg/m(2) to dose level 2 of 850 mg/m(2). A total of 13 patients were enrolled at the MTD of 850 mg/m(2). The number of average weeks that C was delivered was seven of nine planned.
CONCLUSION: C-TPF appears to be safe and feasible as given in this study. GI toxicity (mucositis, enteritis, and diarrhea) appears to be the major combined DLT. Reducing the FU in TPF to 850 mg/m(2) reduces GI toxicity and is the recommended phase II dose.},

Delayed recognition of IO toxicity can be life-threatening or even fatal. To address this issue, intervention is possible at three levels: patients, medical providers, and institutions. Patients and the medical community need institutional safeguards in place to promote swift recognition, assessment, and treatment of IO toxicity. Patients receiving IO therapy must be educated to identify the drugs they have received and to recognize potential IO toxicity, and they must know how to report symptoms. Medical providers must be able to reliably identify that patients have received IO therapy as well as recognize rare or subtle symptoms of IO toxicity. Institutions can establish guidelines and order sets to standardize the treatment of patients receiving IO therapy with irAEs, including the complex management of steroid-refractory irAEs. Additional interventions at an institutional level include identification of IO toxicity champions (subspecialists with expertise in IO toxicity), creating immunotherapy-specific tumor boards and lecture series to educate clinicians and staff, and establishing research programs to evaluate IO toxicity. IO therapy and toxicity experiences must be published and shared with both oncology and nononcology providers in the local, national, and international medical community. These efforts aim to improve patient-related outcomes, increase provider education and awareness, and build institutional safety standards for our oncology patients.},

It had 2 coprimary end points: OS and RFS. A 2-step hierarchic approach first evaluated ipi3 versus HDI followed by ipi10 versus HDI.
RESULTS: Between May 2011 and August 2014, 1,670 adult patients were centrally randomly assigned (1:1:1) to ipi3 (n = 523), HDI (n = 636), or ipi10 (n = 511). Treatment-related adverse events grade ≥ 3 occurred in 37\% of patients receiving ipi3, 79\% receiving HDI, and 58\% receiving ipi10, with adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation in 35\%, 20\%, and 54\%, respectively. Comparison of ipi3 versus HDI used an intent-to-treat analysis of concurrently randomly assigned patient cases (n = 1,051) and showed significant OS difference in favor of ipi3 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95.6\% repeated CI, 0.61 to 0.99; P = .044; RFS: HR, 0.85; 99.4\% CI, 0.66 to 1.09; P = .065). In the second step, for ipi10 versus HDI (n = 989), trends in favor of ipi10 did not achieve statistical significance. Salvage patterns after melanoma relapse showed significantly higher rates of ipilimumab and ipilimumab/anti-programmed death 1 use in the HDI arm versus ipi3 and ipi10 (P ≤ .001).
CONCLUSION: Adjuvant therapy with ipi3 benefits survival versus HDI; for the first time to our knowledge in melanoma adjuvant therapy, E1609 has demonstrated a significant improvement in OS against an active control regimen. The currently approved adjuvant ipilimumab dose (ipi10) was more toxic and not superior in efficacy to HDI.},

Seventy-two patients received parsaclisib monotherapy (5-45 mg once daily). Expansion doses were 20 and 30 mg once daily; intermittent dosing at 20 mg (once daily for 9 weeks, then once weekly) was explored. No dose-limiting toxicities were identified, and maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Most common nonhematologic treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were diarrhea/colitis (36\%), nausea (36\%), fatigue (31\%), and rash (31\%). Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 19\% of patients. Serious TEAEs ({\textgreater}2 patients) were diarrhea/colitis (n = 9), pyrexia (n = 4), hypotension (n = 3), and sepsis (n = 3). Aspartate and alanine transaminase elevations occurring before treatment discontinuation were grade 1, except 1 grade 3 event each, secondary to sepsis. Two patients experienced 3 fatal parsaclisib-unrelated TEAEs (respiratory failure; respiratory failure and sepsis). In non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), objective response rates to monotherapy were 71\% in follicular lymphoma, 78\% in marginal zone lymphoma, 67\% in mantle cell lymphoma, and 30\% in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; 93\% of responses occurred at first assessment (∼9 weeks). Parsaclisib has demonstrated antitumor activity in relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL with the potential for improved long-term patient outcomes. Phase 2 studies in relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL subtypes are ongoing. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as \#NCT02018861.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dulaglutide (dula, LY2189265), a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, is being developed to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: To foster the development of dula, we designed a two-stage adaptive, dose-finding, inferentially seamless phase 2/3 study. The Bayesian theoretical framework is used to adaptively randomize patients in stage 1 to 7 dula doses and, at the decision point, to either stop for futility or to select up to 2 dula doses for stage 2. After dose selection, patients continue to be randomized to the selected dula doses or comparator arms. Data from patients assigned the selected doses will be pooled across both stages and analyzed with an analysis of covariance model, using baseline hemoglobin A1c and country as covariates. The operating characteristics of the trial were assessed by extensive simulation studies.
RESULTS: Simulations demonstrated that the adaptive design would identify the correct doses 88\% of the time, compared to as low as 6\% for a fixed-dose design (the latter value based on frequentist decision rules analogous to the Bayesian decision rules for adaptive design).
CONCLUSIONS: This article discusses the decision rules used to select the dula dose(s); the mathematical details of the adaptive algorithm-including a description of the clinical utility index used to mathematically quantify the desirability of a dose based on safety and efficacy measurements; and a description of the simulation process and results that quantify the operating characteristics of the design.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy and safety of pediatric phase I oncology trials in the era of dose-intensive chemotherapy and to analyze how efficiently these trials are conducted.
METHODS: Phase I pediatric oncology trials published from 1990 to 2004 and their corresponding adult phase I trials were reviewed. Dose escalation schemes using fixed 30\% dose increments were studied to theoretically determine whether trials could be completed utilizing fewer patients and dose levels.
RESULTS: Sixty-nine pediatric phase I oncology trials enrolling 1,973 patients were identified. The pediatric maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was strongly correlated with the adult MTD (r = 0.97). For three-fourths of the trials, the pediatric and adult MTD differed by no more than 30\%, and for more than 85\% of the trials, the pediatric MTD was less than or equal to 1.6 times the adult MTD. The median number of dose levels studied was four (range, two to 13). The overall objective response rate was 9.6\%, the likelihood of experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity was 24\%, and toxic death rate was 0.5\%.
CONCLUSION: Despite the strong correlation between the adult and pediatric MTDs, more than four dose levels were studied in 40\% of trials. There appeared to be little value in exploring dose levels greater than 1.6 times the adult MTD. Limiting pediatric phase I trials to a maximum of four doses levels would significantly shorten the timeline for study conduct without compromising safety.},

In the treatment of cancer with 5-fluorouracil, the administration of folates mechanistically leads to the formation of [6R]-5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate, and the increased concentration of this molecule leads to stabilization of the ternary complex comprising thymidylate synthase, 2'-deoxy-uridine-5'-monophosphate, and [6R]-5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate. The latter is the only natural folate that can bind directly in the ternary complex, with other folates requiring metabolic activation. Modulation of thymidylate synthase activity became central in the study of folate/cytotoxic combinations and, despite wide use, research into the folate component was neglected, leaving important questions unanswered. This article revisits the mechanisms of action of folates and evaluates commercially available folate derivatives in the light of current research.

Even with the progress made through data-sharing initiatives, there is a clear unmet need for easily accessible analyses tools. These include capabilities to efficiently process large sequencing database projects to present them in a straightforward and accurate way. Another urgent challenge in cancer research is to identify more effective combination therapies.
METHODS: We have created a software architecture that allows the user to integrate and analyze large-scale sequencing, clinical, and other datasets for efficient prediction of potential combination drug targets. This architecture permits predictions for all genes pairs; however, Food and Drug Administration-approved agents are currently lacking for most of the identified gene targets.
RESULTS: By applying this approach, we performed a comprehensive study and analyzed all possible combination partners and identified potentially synergistic target pairs for 38 approved targets currently in clinical use. We further showed which genes could be synergistic prediction markers and potential targets with MAPK/ERK inhibitors for the treatment of melanoma. Moreover, we integrated a graph analytics technique in this architecture to identify pathways that could be targeted synergistically to enhance the efficacy of certain therapeutics in cancer.
CONCLUSION: The architecture and the results presented provide a foundation for discovering effective combination therapeutics.},

Great progress has been made in quantitative modeling of evolution using fitness landscapes, allowing a degree of prediction for future evolutionary histories. Yet fine-grained control of the speed and the distributions of these trajectories remains elusive. We propose an approach to achieve this using ideas originally developed in a completely different context: counterdiabatic driving to control the behavior of quantum states for applications like quantum computing and manipulating ultra-cold atoms. Implementing these ideas for the first time in a biological context, we show how a set of external control parameters (i.e. varying drug concentrations / types, temperature, nutrients) can guide the probability distribution of genotypes in a population along a specified path and time interval. This level of control, allowing empirical optimization of evolutionary speed and trajectories, has myriad potential applications, from enhancing adaptive therapies for diseases, to the development of thermotolerant crops in preparation for climate change, to accelerating bioengineering methods built on evolutionary models, like directed evolution of biomolecules.},

	abstract = {In this study, we compared the genomic integration efficiencies and transposition site preferences of Sleeping Beauty (SB or SB11), Tol2, and piggyBac (PB) transposon systems in primary T cells derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and umbilical cord blood (UCB). We found that PB demonstrated the highest efficiency of stable gene transfer in PBL-derived T cells, whereas SB11 and Tol2  mediated intermediate and lowest efficiencies, respectively. Southern hybridization analysis demonstrated that PB generated the highest number of integrants when compared to SB and Tol2 in both PBL and UCB T cells. Tol2 and PB  appeared more likely to promote clonal expansion than SB, which may be in part due to the dysregulated expression of cancer-related genes near the insertion sites. Genome-wide integration analysis demonstrated that SB, Tol2, and PB integrations occurred in all the chromosomes without preference. Additionally, Tol2 and PB integration sites were mainly localized near transcriptional start sites (TSSs), CpG islands and DNaseI hypersensitive sites, whereas SB integrations were randomly distributed. These results suggest that SB may be a preferential choice of the delivery vector in T cells due to its random integration site preference and relatively high efficiency, and support continuing development of SB-mediated T-cell phase I trials.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: A novel nanomedicine, CYT-6091, constructed by simultaneously binding recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (rhTNF) and thiolyated polyethylene glycol to the surface of 27-nm colloidal gold particles, was tested in a phase I  dose escalation clinical trial in advanced stage cancer patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CYT-6091, whose dosing was based on the amount of rhTNF in the nanomedicine, was injected intravenously, and 1 cycle of treatment consisted of 2 treatments administered 14 days apart. RESULTS: Doses from 50 mug/m(2) to 600 mug/m(2) were well tolerated, and no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached, as the highest dose exceeded the target dosage of 1-mg rhTNF per treatment, exceeding the previous MTD for native rhTNF by 3-fold. The first 2 patients on the study, each receiving 50 mug/m(2), did not receive any prophylactic antipyretics or H2 blockade. A predicted, yet controllable fever occurred in these patients, so all subsequently treated patients received prophylactic antipyretics and H2 blockers. However, even at the highest dose rhTNF's dose-limiting toxic effect of hypotension was not seen. Using electron microscopy to visualize nanoparticles of gold in patient biopsies of tumor and healthy tissue showed that patient biopsies taken 24 hours after treatment had nanoparticles of gold in tumor tissue. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that rhTNF formulated as CYT-6091 may be administered systemically at doses of rhTNF that were previously shown to be toxic and that CYT-6091 may target to tumors. Future clinical studies will focus on combining CYT-6091 with approved chemotherapies for the systemic treatment of nonresectable cancers.},

	abstract = {WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor with activity against B-raf, C-raf, VEGFR2, PDGFRbeta and FGFR1. Sorafenib is clinically approved for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The pharmacokinetics (PK) of sorafenib are highly variable between subjects. Sorafenib exposure increases less than dose proportionally (likely due to limited solubility). Sorafenib undergoes enterohepatic recycling (EHC). WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This is the first study to characterize the PK of sorafenib using a model based on sorafenib's known disposition characteristics such as delayed/solubility-limited GI absorption and  EHC. The parameterization of the EHC model used a square wave function to describe the gall bladder emptying. This study evaluated the effect of baseline bodyweight, BSA, age, gender, liver function parameters, kidney function parameters and genotype with respect to CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5*3C, UGT1A9*3 and UGT1A9*5 on sorafenib PK. No clinically important covariates were identified. This model can be used to simulate and explore alternative dosing regimens and to develop exposure-response relationships for sorafenib. AIMS: To characterize the  pharmacokinetics (PK) of sorafenib in patients with solid tumours and to evaluate the possible effects of demographic, clinical and pharmacogenetic (CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5*3C, UGT1A9*3 and UGT1A9*5) covariates on the disposition of sorafenib. METHODS: PK were assessed in 111 patients enrolled in five phase I and II clinical trials, where sorafenib 200 or 400 mg was administered twice daily as a  single agent or in combination therapy. All patients were genotyped for polymorphisms in metabolic enzymes for sorafenib. Population PK analysis was performed by using nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM). The final model was validated using visual predictive checks and nonparametric bootstrap analysis. RESULTS: A one compartment model with four transit absorption compartments and enterohepatic circulation (EHC) adequately described sorafenib disposition. Baseline bodyweight was a statistically significant covariate for distributional volume, accounting for 4\% of inter-individual variability (IIV). PK model parameter estimates (range) for an 80 kg patient were clearance 8.13 l h(-1) (3.6-22.3 l h(-1) ), volume 213 l (50-1000 l), mean absorption transit time 1.98 h (0.5-13 h), fraction undergoing EHC 50\% and average time to gall bladder emptying 6.13 h. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, population PK analysis was consistent with known biopharmaceutical/PK characteristics of oral sorafenib. No clinically important PK covariates were identified.},

Varying schedules and doses of intravenous topotecan in combination with ABT-888 (10 mg)  administered orally twice a day (BID) were evaluated. Plasma and urine pharmacokinetics were assessed and levels of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) and the DNA damage marker gammaH2AX were measured in tumor and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Twenty-four patients were enrolled. Significant myelosuppression limited the ability to coadminister ABT-888 with standard doses of topotecan, necessitating dose reductions. Preclinical studies using athymic mice carrying human tumor xenografts also informed schedule changes. The MTD was established as topotecan 0.6 mg/m(2)/d and ABT-888 10 mg BID on days one to five of 21-day cycles. Topotecan did not alter the pharmacokinetics of ABT-888. A more than 75\%  reduction in PAR levels was observed in 3 paired tumor biopsy samples; a greater  than 50\% reduction was observed in PBMCs from 19 of 23 patients with measurable levels. Increases in gammaH2AX response in circulating tumor cells (CTC) and PBMCs were observed in patients receiving ABT-888 with topotecan. We show a mechanistic interaction of a PARP inhibitor, ABT-888, with a topoisomerase I inhibitor, topotecan, in PBMCs, tumor, and CTCs. Results of this trial reveal that PARP inhibition can modulate the capacity to repair topoisomerase I-mediated DNA damage in the clinic.},

This first-in-human, phase I, open-label study assessed safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of TRC105 in patients with advanced refractory solid tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received escalating doses of intravenous TRC105 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity using a  standard 3 + 3 phase I design. RESULTS: Fifty patients were treated with escalating doses of TRC105. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded at 15 mg/kg every week because of dose-limiting hypoproliferative anemia. TRC105 exposure increased with increasing dose, and continuous serum concentrations that saturate CD105 receptors were maintained at 10 mg/kg weekly (the MTD) and 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Common adverse events including anemia, telangiectasias, and infusion reactions reflected the mechanism of action of the drug. Antibodies to TRC105 were not detected in patients treated with TRC105 from Chinese hamster ovary cells being used in ongoing phase Ib and phase II studies. Stable disease or better was achieved in 21 of 45 evaluable patients (47\%), including two ongoing responses at 48 and 18 months. CONCLUSION: TRC105 was tolerated at 10 mg/kg every week and 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks, with a safety profile that was distinct from that of VEGF inhibitors. Evidence of clinical activity was seen in  a refractory patient population. Ongoing clinical trials are testing TRC105 in combination with chemotherapy and VEGF inhibitors and as a single agent in prostate, ovarian, bladder, breast, and hepatocellular cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Topoisomerase I (Top1) is a proven target for cancer therapeutics. Recent data from the Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin, CPT-11: Use and Sequencing (FOCUS) trial demonstrated that nuclear staining of Top1 correlates with chemotherapeutic efficacy. Such a correlation may help identify patients likely to respond to Top1 inhibitors and illuminate their mechanism of action. Cellular  response to Top1 inhibitors is complex, but Top1 target engagement is a necessary first step in this process. This paper reports the development and validation of  a quantitative immunoassay for Top1 in tumors. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have developed and validated a two-site enzyme chemiluminescent immunoassay for quantifying Top1 levels in tumor biopsies. Analytical validation of the assay established the inter-day coefficient of variation at 9.3\%+/-3.4\% and a 96.5\%+/-7.3\% assay accuracy. Preclinical fit-for-purpose modeling of topotecan time- and dose-effects was performed using topotecan-responsive and -nonresponsive xenografts in athymic nude mice. Higher baseline levels of Top1 were observed in topotecan-responsive than -nonresponsive tumors. Top1 levels reached a maximal decrease 4 to 7 hours following treatment of engrafted mice with topotecan and the indenoisoquinoline NSC 724998. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our analysis of Top1 levels in control and treated tumors supports the previously proposed mechanism of action for Top1 inhibitor efficacy, wherein higher baseline Top1 levels lead to formation of more covalent-complex-dependent double-strand break damage and, ultimately, cell death. In contrast, xenografts with lower baseline Top1 levels accumulate fewer double-stand breaks, and may be more resistant to Top1 inhibitors. Our results support further investigation into the  use of Top1 levels in tumors as a potential predictive biomarker. The Top1 immunoassay described in this paper has been incorporated into a Phase I clinical trial at the National Cancer Institute to assess pharmacodynamic response in tumor biopsies and determine whether baseline Top1 levels are predictive of response to indenoisoquinoline Top1 inhibitors.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd), a halogenated nucleoside analog, produced clinical responses when administered as a radiosensitizer via continuous intravenous (c.i.v.) infusion over the course of radiotherapy. We conducted a phase 0 trial of 5-iodo-2-pyrimidinone-2'-deoxyribose (IPdR), an oral prodrug of  IdUrd, in patients with advanced malignancies to assess whether the oral route was a feasible alternative to c.i.v. infusion before embarking on large-scale clinical trials. Plasma concentrations of IPdR, IdUrd, and other metabolites were measured after a single oral dose of IPdR. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eligible patients had advanced refractory malignancies. A single oral dose of IPdR was administered per patient and patients were followed for 14 days for safety assessments; dose escalations were planned (150, 300, 600, 1,200, and 2,400 mg) with one patient per dose level and 6 patients at the highest dose level. Blood sampling was conducted over a 24-hour period for pharmacokinetic analysis. RESULTS: There were no drug-related adverse events. Plasma concentrations of IdUrd generally increased as the dose of IPdR escalated from 150 to 2,400 mg. All patients at the 2,400 mg dose achieved peak IdUrd levels of (mean +/- SD) 4.0 mumol/L +/- 1.02 mumol/L at 1.67 +/- 1.21 hours after IPdR administration. CONCLUSIONS: Adequate plasma levels of IdUrd were obtained to justify proceeding with a phase I trial of IPdR in combination with radiation. This trial shows the ability of a small, phase 0 study to provide critical information for decision-making regarding future development of a drug.},

The CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor, which  is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stem cell mobilization in cancer and administered for that indication at 0.24 mg/kg, has been shown in short-term (1- to 2-week) phase 1 dose-escalation studies to correct neutropenia and other cytopenias in WHIM syndrome. However, long-term safety and long-term hematologic and clinical efficacy data are lacking. Here we  report results from the first long-term clinical trial of plerixafor in any disease, in which 3 adults with WHIM syndrome self-injected 0.01 to 0.02 mg/kg (4\% to 8\% of the FDA-approved dose) subcutaneously twice daily for 6 months. Circulating leukocytes were durably increased throughout the trial in all patients, and this was associated with fewer infections and improvement in warts  in combination with imiquimod; however, immunoglobulin levels and specific vaccine responses were not fully restored. No drug-associated side effects were observed. These results provide preliminary evidence for the safety and clinical  efficacy of long-term, low-dose plerixafor in WHIM syndrome and support its continued study as mechanism-based therapy in this disease.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Melanoma incidence and mortality rates in Idaho are higher than national averages. The importance of increased awareness of skin cancer has been  cited by state and local organizations. St. Luke's Mountain States Tumor Institute (MSTI) prioritized educational outreach efforts to focus on the implementation of a skin cancer prevention program in rural Idaho. COMMUNITY CONTEXT: As a community cancer center, MSTI expanded cancer education services to include dedicated support to rural communities. Through this expansion, an MSTI educator sought to partner with a community organization to provide sun-safety education. MSTI selected, adapted, and implemented an evidence-based program, Pool Cool. METHODS: The education program was implemented in 5 phases. In Phase I, we identified and recruited a community partner; in Phase 2, after thorough research, we selected a program, Pool Cool; in Phase 3, we planned the details of the program, including identification of desired short- and long-term outcomes and adaptation of existing program materials; in Phase 4, we implemented the program in summer 2012; in Phase 5, we assessed program sustainability and expansion. OUTCOME: MSTI developed a sustainable partnership with Payette Municipal Pool, and in summer 2012, we implemented Pool Cool. Sun-safety education was provided to more than 700 young people aged 2 to 17 years, and educational signage and sunscreen benefitted hundreds of additional pool patrons. INTERPRETATION: Community cancer centers are increasingly being asked to assess community needs and implement evidence-based prevention and screening programs. Clinical staff may become facilitators of evidence-based public health programs.  Challenges of implementing evidence-based programs in the context of a community  cancer centers are staffing, leveraging of resources, and ongoing training and support.},

	abstract = {Exciting recent advancements in deep-sequencing technology have enabled a rapid and cost-effective molecular characterization of patient-derived tumor samples. Incorporating these innovative diagnostic technologies into early clinical trials could significantly propel implementation of precision medicine by identifying genetic markers predictive of sensitivity to agents. It may also markedly accelerate drug development and subsequent regulatory approval of novel agents. Particularly noteworthy, a high-response rate in a Phase II trial involving a biomarker-enriched patient cohort could result in a regulatory treatment approval in rare histologies, which otherwise would not be a candidate for a large randomized clinical trial. Furthermore, even if a trial does not meet its statistical endpoint, tumors from a few responders should be molecularly characterized as part of the new biomarker-mining processes. In order to accommodate patient screening and accelerate the accrual process, institutions conducting early clinical trials need to be a part of a multi-institution clinical trials network. Future clinical trial design will incorporate new biomarkers discovered by a 'phenotype-to-genotype' effort with an appropriate statistical design. To help advance such changes, the National Cancer Institute has recently reformed the existing early phase clinical trials network. A new clinical trial network, the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ET-CTN), was begun and, in addition to its pre-existing infrastructure, an up-to-date clinical trial registration system, clinical trial monitoring system including electronic database and a central Institutional Review Board were formed. Ultimately, these reforms support identifying the most appropriate therapy for each tumor type by incorporating state-of-the-art molecular diagnostic tools into early clinical trials.},

A randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing alternative fludarabine dosing strategies to current practice may be warranted, but should be sufficiently powered for a relevant end point, while still feasible to enroll. To find the optimal design, we simulated RCTs comparing current practice (160 mg/m2 ) to either covariate-based or therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)-guided dosing with potential outcomes being nonrelapse mortality (NRM), graft failure, or relapse, and ultimately overall survival (covering all three aforementioned outcomes). The inclusion in each treatment arm (n) required to achieve 80\% power was calculated for all combinations of end points and dosing comparisons. The trial requiring the lowest n for sufficient power compared TDM-guided dosing to current practice with NRM as primary outcome (n = 70, NRM decreasing from 21\% to 5.7\%). We conclude that a superiority trial is feasible.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (NIVO1+IPI3) is approved for first-line treatment of patients with advanced melanoma in several countries. We conducted a phase IIIb/IV study (CheckMate 511) to determine if nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (NIVO3+IPI1) improves the safety profile of the combination.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (N = 360) age 18 years or older with previously untreated, unresectable stage III or IV melanoma were randomly assigned 1:1 to NIVO3+IPI1 or NIVO1+IPI3 once every 3 weeks for four doses. After 6 weeks, all patients received NIVO 480 mg once every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was a comparison of the incidence of treatment-related grade 3 to 5 adverse events (AEs) between groups. Secondary end points included descriptive analyses of objective response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The study was not designed to formally demonstrate noninferiority of NIVO3+IPI1 to NIVO1+IPI3 for efficacy end points.
RESULTS: At a minimum follow-up of 12 months, incidence of treatment-related grade 3 to 5 AEs was 34\% with NIVO3+IPI1 versus 48\% with NIVO1+IPI3 ( P = .006). In descriptive analyses, objective response rate was 45.6\% in the NIVO3+IPI1 group and 50.6\% in the NIVO1+IPI3 group, with complete responses in 15.0\% and 13.5\% of patients, respectively. Median progression-free survival was 9.9 months in the NIVO3+IPI1 group and 8.9 months in the NIVO1+IPI3 group. Median overall survival was not reached in either group.
CONCLUSION: The CheckMate 511 study met its primary end point, demonstrating a significantly lower incidence of treatment-related grade 3-5 AEs with NIVO3+IPI1 versus NIVO1+IPI3. Descriptive analyses showed that there were no meaningful differences between the groups for any efficacy end point, although longer follow up may help to better characterize efficacy outcomes.},

	abstract = {5026  Background: Sorafenib has demonstrated activity with limited toxicity at a dose of 400 mg bid in MRCC pts. This presents an opportunity to explore a more intensive drug administration. This study allowed individual pt titration designed to evaluate the ability for pts to dose escalate. Response rate (RR), time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) will be assessed. Methods: Eligibility included; pathologic diagnosis of a component of clear cell, progressive measurable MRCC, no more than 1 prior therapy, karnofsky performance status (KPS) = 70\%, adequate organ/marrow function and no active CNS involvement. Initial dose 400 mg bid, daily. Dose escalation defined in the table below: Re-evaluation is performed every 8 weeks. RECIST criteria is utilized. Results: 46 patients have been enrolled. 44 are evaluable. 37 male/7 female, median age 50 years (43–79). 19 pts received prior therapy. 39 pts had a KPS of 100\%, 5/90\%. Sites of disease included; lung, nodal, liver, bone, adrenal, pancreas and kidney. 26 pts 1 metastatic site, 12 /2, 6/3 or more. 22 pts continue to receive sorafenib therapy; 2/800 mg, 7/1,200 mg, and 13/1,600 mg. 8 pts complete response (CR), 14 pts/partial response (PR) and 14 pts stable for 3+ months.

	abstract = {5122  Background: An earlier phase II study (J Clin Oncol. Vol 25, No. 18S, 2007: Abstract 5026), we were able to show that pts who were able to tolerate doses higher than the FDA-approved dose have significantly improved clinical outcomes, including remission, tumor shrinkage, growth arrest and will have lesser side effects over time. We have expanded the phase II study to determine if an increase in dose will result in higher AUC and Cmax level. Response rate, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed. Methods: Pts had a confirmed component of clear cell RCC, progressive measurable metastatic disease, adequate organ/marrow function, and no more than 1 prior therapy. The initial dose of sorafenib was 400 mg PO, BID, daily days 1 to 28. Dose escalation was defined as; on day 29 through day 56, an increase to 600 mg BID and on day 57 throughout as tolerated 800 mg BID daily. Dose modifications were performed for toxicity per the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Version 3.0. Pts were evaluated every 2 cycles (8 weeks) using RECIST. PFS and OS were determined from entry into the study. Blood and urine samples are obtained on days 28, 56, and 84. Results: Twenty-two pts were enrolled to date, 19 are evaluable for a response and toxicity, and 3 for toxicity only. One pt had a complete response (CR), 5 pts partial response (PR) and 7 pts stable disease (SD) for 3 months or more. One pt had progressive disease and it is still too early to assess 5 pts. Most common treatment related adverse events; hand/foot syndrome, skin rash, diarrhea, alopecia, fatigue and hypertension. Noted laboratory abnormalities; hypophosphatemia. Conclusions: 14/14 pts were escalated to 1,600 mg per day. Dose escalated sorafenib has promising anti-tumor activity in pts with MRCC as demonstrated by a 32\% CR/PR rate and is further suggested by a prolonged PFS ≥3 months for an additional 50\% of pts.

	abstract = {Optimal control theory is branch of mathematics that aims to optimize a solution to a dynamical system. While the concept of using optimal control theory to improve treatment regimens in oncology is not novel, many of the early applications of this mathematical technique were not designed to work with routinely available data or produce results that can eventually be translated to the clinical setting. The purpose of this review is to discuss clinically relevant considerations for formulating and solving optimal control problems for treating cancer patients. Our review focuses on two of the most widely used cancer treatments, radiation therapy and systemic therapy, as they naturally lend themselves to optimal control theory as a means to personalize therapeutic plans in a rigorous fashion. To provide context for optimal control theory to address either of these two modalities, we first discuss the major limitations and difficulties oncologists face when considering alternate regimens for their patients. We then provide a brief introduction to optimal control theory before formulating the optimal control problem in the context of radiation and systemic therapy. We also summarize examples from the literature that illustrate these concepts. Finally, we present both challenges and opportunities for dramatically improving patient outcomes via the integration of clinically relevant, patient-specific, mathematical models and optimal control theory.},

	abstract = {While there is recognition that more informative clinical endpoints can support better decision-making in clinical trials, it remains a common practice to categorize endpoints originally measured on a continuous scale. The primary motivation for this categorization (and most commonly dichotomization) is the simplicity of the analysis. There is, however, a long argument that this simplicity can come at a high cost. Specifically, larger sample sizes are needed to achieve the same level of accuracy when using a dichotomized outcome instead of the original continuous endpoint. The degree of "loss of information" has been studied in the contexts of parallel-group designs and two-stage Phase II trials. Limited attention, however, has been given to the quantification of the associated losses in dose-ranging trials. In this work, we propose an approach to estimate the associated losses in Phase II dose-ranging trials that is free of the actual dose-ranging design used and depends on the clinical setting only. The approach uses the notion of a nonparametric optimal benchmark for dose-finding trials, an evaluation tool that facilitates the assessment of a dose-finding design by providing an upper bound on its performance under a given scenario in terms of the probability of the target dose selection. After demonstrating how the benchmark can be applied to Phase II dose-ranging trials, we use it to quantify the dichotomization losses. Using parameters from real clinical trials in various therapeutic areas, it is found that the ratio of sample sizes needed to obtain the same precision using continuous and binary (dichotomized) endpoints varies between 70\% and 75\% under the majority of scenarios but can drop to 50\% in some cases.},

	abstract = {Background: Teclistamab (JNJ-64007957) is a bispecific BCMA x CD3 antibody that induces T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against BCMA-expressing myeloma cells. Initial results from an ongoing study of teclistamab in RRMM (NCT03145181) are presented. Methods: Pts have MM and are RR to standard therapies. Primary objective for part 1 is to identify a recommended phase 2 dose(s). Multiple intravenous (iv) doses ± priming doses were explored. Adverse events (AEs) were graded per CTCAE v4.03 and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) per Lee et al 2014. Response was investigator-assessed using IMWG criteria; minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow was assessed by next generation sequencing. Results: As of 31 Jan 2020, 66 pts had received iv teclistamab (0.3–270 µg/kg). Median age was 64 y (24–82), median prior therapies was 6 (2–14), 97\% triple-class exposed, 83\% triple-class refractory, and 38\% penta-drug refractory. Most common treatment-related AEs (all grade) were CRS (56\%), neutropenia (26\%), and anemia (23\%). CRS events were all grade 1–2 and generally confined to initial doses. 8\% of pts had treatment-related neurotoxicity (3\% grade ≥3), and 9\% had infusion related reaction. Infection-related AEs were reported in 61\% of pts (21\% grade ≥3). 2 dose-limiting toxicities were reported: grade 4 delirium (resolved after 16 days) and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (resolved after 1 day). 36\% of pts had treatment-related grade ≥3 AEs; neutropenia (20\%) and anemia (14\%) were most frequent. Only 1 grade 5 AE was reported (respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonia deemed unrelated by the investigator). PK results indicate that the half-life of teclistamab supports weekly dosing. On-target pharmacodynamic activity (T cell redistribution and activation along with transient release of cytokines) was observed at doses ≥9.6 µg/kg. Cytokine production was modulated with step-up dosing while T cell activation was maintained. 65 pts were evaluable for response. Activity was observed starting at treatment doses ≥38.4 µg/kg, with 20/52 (38\%) pts achieving a response. At the highest dose, 7/9 (78\%) pts responded (1 response pending confirmation). Of MRD-evaluable pts who had complete response, 2/2 were MRD negative at 10
              −6
              with treatment ongoing {\textgreater} 12 mo. Conclusions: Teclistamab has manageable safety across all doses explored. A 78\% overall response rate was observed at the highest weekly treatment dose in pts with advanced RRMM, supporting further evaluation of teclistamab in expansion cohorts.

	abstract = {Phase 1 cancer studies, which guide dose selection for subsequent studies, are almost 3 times more prevalent than phase 3 studies and have a median study duration considerably longer than 2 years, which constitutes a major component of drug development time.To discern a method to reduce the duration of phase 1 studies in adult and pediatric cancer studies without violating risk limits by better accommodating the accrual and evaluation process (or queue).The process modeled, the phase 1 queue (IQ), includes patient interarrival time, screening, and dose-limiting toxicity evaluation. For this proof of principle, the rules of the 3 + 3 and rolling 6 phase 1 designs were modified to improve patient flow through the queue without exceeding the maximum risk permitted in the parent designs. The resulting designs, the IQ 3 + 3 and the IQ rolling 6, were each compared with their parent design by simulations in 12 different scenarios.(1) The time from study opening to determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), (2) the number of patients treated to determine the MTD, and (3) the association of the design with the dose selected as the MTD.Based on 800 simulations, for all 12 scenarios considered, the IQ 3 + 3 and the IQ rolling 6 designs were associated with reduced expected study durations compared with the parent design. The expected IQ 3 + 3 reduction ranged from 1.6 to 10.4 months (with 3.7 months for the standard scenario), and the expected reduction associated with IQ rolling 6 ranged from 0.4 to 10.5 months (with 3.4 months for the standard scenario). The increase in the mean number of patients treated in the IQ 3 + 3 compared with the 3 + 3 ranged from 0.6 to 3.2 patients. No increase in the number of patients was associated with the IQ rolling 6 compared with the rolling 6 design. The probability of selecting a dose level as the MTD changed by less than 3\% for all dose levels and scenarios in both parent designs.This study found that IQ designs were associated with reduced mean duration of phase 1 studies compared with their parent designs without changing the risk limits or MTD selection operating characteristics. These approaches have been successfully implemented in both hematology and solid tumor phase 1 studies.},

We present an analysis of the incidence, characteristics, prognostic factors, and outcome of 739 APL patients treated with ATRA plus idarubicin in 2 consecutive trials (Programa Español de Tratamientos en Hematología [PETHEMA] LPA96 and LPA99). Overall, 183 patients (24.8\%) experienced DS, 93 with a severe form (12.6\%) and 90 with a moderate form (12.2\%). Severe but not moderate DS was associated with an increase in mortality. A bimodal incidence of DS was observed, with peaks occurring in the first and third weeks after the start of ATRA therapy. A multivariate analysis indicated that a WBC count greater than 5 x 10(9)/L and an abnormal serum creatinine level correlated with an increased risk of developing severe DS. Patients receiving systematic prednisone prophylaxis (LPA99 trial) in contrast to those receiving selective prophylaxis with dexamethasone (LPA96 trial) had a lower incidence of severe DS. Patients developing severe DS showed a reduced 7-year relapse-free survival in the LPA96 trial (60\% vs 85\%, P = .003), but this difference was not apparent in the LPA99 trial (86\% vs 88\%).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: New treatments have improved outcomes for patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but complete remissions remain uncommon. Venetoclax has a distinct mechanism of action; it targets BCL2, a protein central to the survival of CLL cells.
METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 dose-escalation study of daily oral venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) to assess safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and efficacy. In the dose-escalation phase, 56 patients received active treatment in one of eight dose groups that ranged from 150 to 1200 mg per day. In an expansion cohort, 60 additional patients were treated with a weekly stepwise ramp-up in doses as high as 400 mg per day.
RESULTS: The majority of the study patients had received multiple previous treatments, and 89\% had poor prognostic clinical or genetic features. Venetoclax was active at all dose levels. Clinical tumor lysis syndrome occurred in 3 of 56 patients in the dose-escalation cohort, with one death. After adjustments to the dose-escalation schedule, clinical tumor lysis syndrome did not occur in any of the 60 patients in the expansion cohort. Other toxic effects included mild diarrhea (in 52\% of the patients), upper respiratory tract infection (in 48\%), nausea (in 47\%), and grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (in 41\%). A maximum tolerated dose was not identified. Among the 116 patients who received venetoclax, 92 (79\%) had a response. Response rates ranged from 71 to 79\% among patients in subgroups with an adverse prognosis, including those with resistance to fludarabine, those with chromosome 17p deletions (deletion 17p CLL), and those with unmutated IGHV. Complete remissions occurred in 20\% of the patients, including 5\% who had no minimal residual disease on flow cytometry. The 15-month progression-free survival estimate for the 400-mg dose groups was 69\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Selective targeting of BCL2 with venetoclax had a manageable safety profile and induced substantial responses in patients with relapsed CLL or SLL, including those with poor prognostic features. (Funded by AbbVie and Genentech; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01328626.).},

The method is fully adaptive, makes use of all the information available at the time of each dose assignment, and directly addresses the ethical need to control the probability of overdosing. It is designed to approach the maximum tolerated dose as fast as possible subject to the constraint that the predicted proportion of patients who receive an overdose does not exceed a specified value. We conducted simulations to compare the proposed method with four up-and-down designs, two stochastic approximation methods, and with a variant of the continual reassessment method. The results showed the proposed method effective as a means to control the frequency of overdosing. Relative to the continual reassessment method, our scheme overdosed a smaller proportion of patients, exhibited fewer toxicities and estimated the maximum tolerated dose with comparable accuracy. When compared to the non-parametric schemes, our method treated fewer patients at either subtherapeutic or severely toxic dose levels, treated more patients at optimal dose levels and estimated the maximum tolerated dose with smaller average bias and mean squared error. Hence, the proposed method is promising alternative to currently used cancer phase I clinical trial designs.},

In situations such as when evaluating late-onset effects of radiation or toxicities from chemopreventive agents, this may result in trials of impractically long duration. We propose a new method, called the time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM), that allows patients to be entered in a staggered fashion. It is an extension of the continual reassessment method (CRM; O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher, 1990, Biometrics 46, 33-48). We also note that this time-to-toxicity approach can be applied to extend other designs for studies of short-term toxicities. We prove that the recommended dose given by the TITE-CRM converges to the correct level under certain conditions. A simulation study shows our method's accuracy and safety are comparable with CRM's while the former takes a much shorter trial duration: a trial that would take up to 12 years to complete by the CRM could be reduced to 2-4 years by our method.},

	doi = {10.1101/150821},
	abstract = {Background: Absent adaptive, individualized dose-finding in early-phase oncology trials, subsequent registration trials risk suboptimal dosing that compromises statistical power and lowers the probability of technical success (PTS) for the investigational drug. While much methodological progress has been made toward adaptive dose-finding, and quantitative modeling of dose-response relationships, most such work continues to be organized around a concept of ‘the’ maximum tolerated dose (MTD). But a new methodology, Dose Titration Algorithm Tuning (DTAT), now holds forth the promise of individualized ‘MTDi’ dosing. Relative to such individualized dosing, current ‘one-size-fits-all’ dosing practices amount to a constraint that imposes costs on society. This paper estimates the magnitude of these costs. Methods: Simulated dose titration as in (Norris F1000Research 2017;6:112) is extended to 1000 subjects, yielding an empirical MTDi distribution to which a gamma density is fitted. Individual-level efficacy, in terms of the probability of achieving remission, is assumed to be an Emax-type function of dose relative to MTDi, scaled (arbitrarily) to identify MTDi with the LD50 of the individual's tumor. (Thus, a criterion 50\% of the population achieve remission under individualized dosing in this analysis.) Current practice is modeled such that all patients receive a first-cycle dose at ‘the’ MTD, and those for whom MTDi {\textless} MTDthe experience a ‘dose-limiting toxicity’ (DLT) that aborts subsequent cycles. Therapy thus terminated is assumed to confer no benefit. Individuals for whom MTDi ≥ MTDthe tolerate a full treatment course, and achieve remission with probability determined by the Emax curve evaluated at MTDthe/MTDi. A closed-form expression is obtained for the population remission rate, and maximized numerically over MTDthe as a free parameter, thus identifying the best result achievable under one-size-fits-all dosing. A sensitivity analysis is performed, using both a perturbation of the assumed Emax function, and an antipodal alternative specification. Results: Simulated MTDi follow a gamma distribution with shape parameter α ≈ 1.75. The population remission rate under one-size-fits-all dosing at the maximizing value of MTDthe proves to be a function of the shape parameter — and thus the coefficient of variation (CV) — of the gamma distribution of MTDi. Within a plausible range of CV(MTDi), one-size-fits-all dosing wastes approximately half of the drug's population-level efficacy. In the sensitivity analysis, sensitivity to the perturbation proves to be of second order. The alternative exposure-efficacy specification likewise leaves all results intact. Conclusions: The CV of MTDi determines the efficacy lost under one-size-fits-all dosing at ‘the’ MTD. Within plausible ranges for this CV, failure to individualize dosing can effectively halve a drug's value to society. In a competitive environment dominated by regulatory hurdles, this may reduce the value of shareholders' investment in the drug to zero. Epilogue: The main result on one-size-fits-all dosing is generalized to regimens with several dose levels. Implications for the ongoing ALTA-1L trial are briefly explored; the 2 dose levels in the brigatinib arm of this trial may lend it a competitive advantage over the single-dose crizotinib arm.},

We compare this estimator to the standard parametric maximum likelihood estimator from a proportional odds model for extremely small data sets. A motivating example is from phase I oncology clinical trials, where various non-parametric designs have been proposed that lead to very small data sets, often with ordinal toxicity response data. Our comparison of estimators is performed in conjunction with three of these non-parametric sequential designs for ordinal response data, two from the literature and a new design based on a random walk rule. We also compare with a non-parametric design for binary response trials, by keeping track of ordinal data for estimation purposes, but dichotomizing the data in the design phase. We find that a multidimensional isotonic regression-based estimator far exceeds the others in terms of accuracy and efficiency. A rule by Simon et al. (J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89:1138-1147) yields particularly efficient estimators, more so than the random walk rule, but has higher numbers of dose-limiting toxicity. A small data set from a leukemia clinical trial is analysed using our multidimensional isotonic regression-based estimator.},

Many trials that support a regulatory application have high rates of dose reductions and discontinuations, which may result in postmarketing requirements (PMR) to study alternate doses or dosing schedules. Kinase inhibitors particularly have been susceptible to this problem, and among the 31 approved drugs of this class, the approvals of eight have included such PMRs and/or commitments. Thus, the current paradigm for dose finding and optimization could be improved. Newer strategies for dose finding rather than traditional 3 + 3 designs should be considered where feasible, and dose optimization should be continued after phase I and throughout development. Such strategies will increase the likelihood of a right dose for the right drug at the time of regulatory approval.

However, not all patients benefit from these therapies, presumably due to pretreatment regimens. Therefore, we determined the effect of different treatment lines on the activity of T cells and their responsiveness to AFM11. AFM11 is a tetravalent, bispecific CD19/CD3 immunoengager based on Affimed's ROCK platform, currently being investigated in phase I clinical trials for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. T cells from B-cell lymphoma patients treated with either rituximab+bendamustine (R-Benda), rituximab+CHOP (R-CHOP), or with high-dose BEAM chemotherapy (HD-BEAM) and autologous HSCT were compared with T cells from healthy donors. Overall, in these patients, T-cell numbers were significantly reduced. To determine whether distinct chemotherapy affects AFM11 efficacy, functional T-cell assays were performed. It is interesting to note that, only in assays that combine target cell lysis, cytokine production and proliferation over 4 days at an effector to target ratio of up to 1:25 significant differences could be detected between the different treatment groups: T cells after R-CHOP showed only modest decrease in their functionality when compared with healthy controls, whereas R-Benda and HD-BEAM had a profound effect on AFM11-induced T-cell cytotoxicity. In conclusion, T cells from lymphoma patients are reduced in number and have functional defects following treatment with certain chemotherapy regimens, also reducing AFM11 efficacy. Importantly, AFM11 was still able to trigger B-cell-directed T-cell immunity in all treatment groups.},

	abstract = {To harness the potent tumor-killing capacity of T cells for the treatment of CD19(+) malignancies, we constructed AFM11, a humanized tetravalent bispecific CD19/CD3 tandem diabody (TandAb) consisting solely of Fv domains. The molecule exhibits good manufacturability and stability properties. AFM11 has 2 binding sites for CD3 and 2 for CD19, an antigen that is expressed from early B cell development through differentiation into plasma cells, and is an attractive alternative to CD20 as a target for the development of therapeutic antibodies to treat B cell malignancies. Comparison of the binding and cytotoxicity of AFM11 with those of a tandem scFv bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) molecule targeting the same antigens revealed that AFM11 elicited more potent in vitro B cell lysis. Though possessing high affinity to CD3, the TandAb mediates serial-killing of CD19(+) cells with little dependence of potency or efficacy upon effector:target ratio, unlike the BiTE. The advantage of the TandAb over the BiTE was most pronounced at lower effector:target ratios. AFM11 mediated strictly target-dependent T cell activation evidenced by CD25 and CD69 induction, proliferation, and cytokine release, notwithstanding bivalent CD3 engagement. In a NOD/scid xenograft model, AFM11 induced dose-dependent growth inhibition of Raji tumors in vivo, and radiolabeled TandAb exhibited excellent localization to tumor but not to normal tissue. After intravenous administration in mice, half-life ranged from 18.4 to 22.9 h. In a human ex vivo B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia study, AFM11 exhibited substantial cytotoxic activity in an autologous setting. Thus, AFM11 may represent a promising therapeutic for treatment of CD19(+) malignancies with an advantageous safety risk profile and anticipated dosing regimen.},

	abstract = {Heidelberg, Germany, October 8, 2018 – Affimed N.V. (Nasdaq: AFMD), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing highly targeted cancer immunotherapies that harness the power of innate and adaptive immunity (NK and T cells), today announced that it has placed AFM11 (CD19/CD3-targeting T cell engager) on clinical hold, and has notified the global health authorities of its decision. AFM11 is being evaluated in two Phase 1 clinical studies for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory CD19 positive B-cell nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The clinical hold was initiated after the occurrence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in three patients, which included a death in the ALL study and two life-threatening events in the NHL study. The SAEs occurred in patients enrolled in the highest dose cohorts of each study. Thirty-three patients have been treated in total in the two Phase 1 studies, with preliminary signs of clinical activity observed in several patients. Affimed will be working closely with the global health authorities, the Safety Monitoring Committees, and the studies’ clinical investigators to review the events, carefully assess all of the data and determine next steps for the AFM11 program. Affimed intends to provide an update on AFM11 upon completion of the evaluation. The clinical hold does not affect the ongoing development of Affimed’s NK cell engager programs, which are based on targeting the NK cell receptor CD16A, a different approach than used for AFM11, which targets T cells through CD3.},

During a prespecified fixed follow-up period, the times to disease progression, toxicity, and death are monitored continuously, and an ordinal disease status variable, including progressive disease (PD) as one level, is evaluated repeatedly by scheduled imaging. We assume a proportional hazards model with piecewise constant baseline hazard for each continuous variable and a longitudinal multinomial probit model for the ordinal disease status process and include multivariate patient frailties to induce association among the outcomes. A finite partition of the nonfatal outcome combinations during the follow-up period is constructed, and the utility of each set in the partition is elicited. Posterior mean utility is used to optimize each patient's dose, subject to a safety rule excluding doses with an unacceptably high rate of PD, severe toxicity, or death. A simulation study shows that, compared with the proposed design, a simpler design based on commonly used efficacy and toxicity outcomes obtained by combining the four variables described above performs poorly and has substantially smaller probabilities of correctly choosing truly optimal doses and excluding truly unsafe doses.},

Although various Bayesian designs for Phase I clinical trials have been proposed in the literature, the traditional 3+3 design is still widely used because of its algorithm-based simplicity in logistics for the clinical investigators to carry out in comparison with model-based Bayesian methods. In this paper, we propose an optimization algorithm for designing phase I cancer clinical trials. This algorithm does not need assumptions on the true dose-response relationship but can readily incorporate available prior information about the true response probabilities. It searches for an approximately optimal design within a design space, in which the 3+3 design is included as a special case. Simulation studies show that the design recommended by this algorithm significantly outperforms the 3+3 design.},

Two divergent schools have developed in designing phase I clinical trials.

The second defines the maximum tolerated dose as a parameter of a monotonic dose-response curve, and hence is estimated. We review techniques from both philosophies. The goal is to present these methods in a single package, to compare them from philosophical and statistical grounds, to hopefully clear up some common misconceptions, and to make a few recommendations.

A patient's dose is unchanged over the cycles and the data are reduced to a binary endpoint and the occurrence of a toxicity and analyzed by considering the toxicity either from the first dose or from any cycle on the study. In this article, an alternative approach allowing an assessment of toxicity from each cycle and dose variations for patient over cycles is presented. A Markov model for the conditional probability of toxicity on any cycle given no toxicity in previous cycles is formulated as a function of the current and previous doses. The extra information from each cycle provides more precise estimation of the dose-toxicity relationship. Simulation results demonstrating gains in using the Markov model as compared to analyses of a single binary outcome are presented. Methods for utilizing the Markov model to conduct a Phase I study, including choices for selecting doses for the next cycle for each patient, are developed and presented via simulation.},

Several works developed designs for more informative endpoints, e.g. ordinal toxicity grades and/or longitudinal data which relied however on strong assumptions, in particular the proportional odds (PO) assumption.
Methods: We evaluated this PO assumption for the dose and cycle on a large database of individual patient data from 54 phase I clinical trials of molecularly targeted agents. The PO model is a specific case of the continuation ratio logit model (CRLM) with null parameters. We compared the PO and CRLM models using the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC). We considered a longitudinal multivariate ordinal toxicity outcome (cutaneous, digestive, hematological, general disorders, and other toxicities).
Results: WAIC suggested that the CRLM model (WAIC = 30911.58) outperformed the PO model (WAIC = 31432.10). Deviance from PO assumption for dose was observed for digestive and general disorder toxicities. There was moderate cycle effect with slight deviance from PO assumption for the other type of toxicity.
Conclusions: Designs based on PO for dose should be a useful tool for drug with low expected digestive or general disorder toxicity dose-related incidence.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Traditional dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) definition, which uses grade (G) 3-4 toxicity data from cycle 1 (C1) only, may not be appropriate for molecularly targeted agents (MTAs) of prolonged administration, for which late or lower grade toxicities also deserve attention.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In collaboration with pharmaceutical companies and academia, an European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-led initiative, Dose-Limiting Toxicity and Toxicity Assessment Recommendation Group for Early Trials of Targeted therapies (DLT-TARGETT), collected data from completed phase 1 trials evaluating MTAs as monotherapy. All toxicities at least possibly related to the study drugs that occurred during C1-6, their type, grade (CTCAEv3.0), and duration as well as patients' relative dose-intensity (RDI), were recorded.
RESULTS: The 54 eligible trials enrolled 2084 evaluable adult patients with solid tumours between 1999 and 2013, and evaluated small molecules (40), antibodies (seven), recombinant peptides (five) and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (two). A maximum tolerated dose was set in 43 trials. Fifteen percent of the patients received {\textless}75\% of the intended RDI in C1, but only 9.1\% of them presented protocol-defined DLTs. After C1, 16-19\% of patients received {\textless}75\% of the intended RDI. A similar proportion of G ⩾ 3 toxicities was recorded in C1 and after C1 (936 and 1087 toxicities, respectively), with the first G⩾3 toxicity occurring after C1 in 18.6\% of patients.
CONCLUSION: Although protocol-defined DLT period is traditionally limited to C1, almost 20\% of patients present significant reductions in RDI at any time in phase 1 trials of MTAs. Recommended phase 2 dose assessment should incorporate all available information from any cycle (notably lower grade toxicities leading to such RDI decrease), and be based on achieving {\textgreater}75\% RDI.},

	abstract = {We consider phase I dose-finding studies for cytotoxic drugs in cancer, where the objective is identification of a target dose (TD100δ ) associated with the probability δ of a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Previous authors have presented a design utilising a Bayesian decision procedure based on a logistic regression model to describe the relationship between dose and the risk of a DLT (LRDP). A cautious prior, chosen to ensure that the first cohort of patients are given the lowest dose, is combined with binary observations of DLTs to update model parameters and choose a safe dose for the next cohort. This process continues with each new cohort of patients. Typically, only DLTs occurring in the first treatment cycle are included. To incorporate data from later cycles, a new Bayesian decision procedure based on an interval-censored survival model (ICSDP) has been developed. This models the probability that the first DLT occurs in each specific cycle via the probability of a DLT during a specific cycle, conditional on having no DLT in any previous cycle. The second cohort of patients start after responses have been obtained from the first cycle of the first cohort, and subsequently, dose selection for each new cohort is based on DLTs observed across all completed cycles for all patients. A simulation study comparing the ICSDP and LRDP showed that the ICSDP induces faster updating of the current estimate of the target dose, leading to shorter trials and fewer patients, whilst keeping the same level of accuracy.},

Some researchers have proposed the use of relative dose intensity that can account for late-onset, cumulative, and low-grade toxicities to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). In this study, we proposed two dose escalation methods based on the observed relative dose intensities (RDIs) between the pre-specified intervals (cycles) for toxicity evaluation used in combination with DLT evaluation in the first cycle. First, we propose the modified 3 + 3 design that incorporates longitudinal RDI assessment. Second, we propose the sequential assessment method for longitudinal RDI (SARDI) to achieve faster dose escalation compared to that of the modified 3 + 3 design. Simulation studies demonstrated that the SARDI was, in many cases, superior to the ordinal and modified 3 + 3 designs in respect to the selection rate of true RP2D and study period. The two proposed methods could also in some cases decrease the average number of patients enrolled in the trial compared to that of the ordinary 3 + 3 design. Incorporation of the RDI assessment into the 3 + 3 design is not difficult and does not require the use of complex statistical techniques. Therefore, we believe that investigators who routinely use the 3 + 3 design in practice can easily use our proposed methods.},

The optimal dose is then the dose producing a target rate of severe toxicity per cycle. This model can also be used to identify cumulative or late toxicities. The performances of this approach were compared with those of the continual reassessment method in a simulation study. Operating characteristics were evaluated in terms of correct identification of the target dose, distribution of the doses allocated and power to detect trends in the risk of toxicities over time. This approach was also used to reanalyse data from a phase I oncology trial.

We compare this approach to a method based on repeated binary variables and to a method based on an under-parameterized model of the dose-time toxicity relationship. We show that repeated binary and ordinal outcomes both improve the accuracy of dose-finding trials in the same proportion; ordinal outcomes are, however, superior to detect time trend even in the presence of nonproportional odds models. Moreover, less parameterized models led to the best operating characteristics. These approaches are illustrated on two dose-finding phase I trials.

	abstract = {CD3 bispecific antibody constructs recruit cytolytic T cells to kill tumor cells, offering a potent approach to treat cancer. T cell activation is driven by the formation of a trimolecular complex (trimer) between drugs, T cells, and tumor cells, mimicking an immune synapse. A translational quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model is proposed for CD3 bispecific molecules capable of predicting trimer concentration and linking it to tumor cell killing. The model was used to quantify the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship of a CD3 bispecific targeting P-cadherin (PF-06671008). It describes the disposition of PF-06671008 in the central compartment and tumor in mouse xenograft models, including binding to target and T cells in the tumor to form the trimer. The model incorporates T cell distribution to the tumor, proliferation, and contraction. PK/PD parameters were estimated for PF-06671008 and a tumor stasis concentration (TSC) was calculated as an estimate of minimum efficacious trimer concentration. TSC values ranged from 0.0092 to 0.064 pM across mouse tumor models. The model was translated to the clinic and used to predict the disposition of PF-06671008 in patients, including the impact of binding to soluble P-cadherin. The predicted terminal half-life of PF-06671008 in the clinic was approximately 1 day, and P-cadherin expression and number of T cells in the tumor were shown to be sensitive parameters impacting clinical efficacy. A translational QSP model is presented for CD3 bispecific molecules, which integrates in silico, in vitro and in vivo data in a mechanistic framework, to quantify and predict efficacy across species.},

	abstract = {Currently many dose-finding clinical trial designs, including the continual reassessment method (CRM) and the standard ' 3 + 3' design, dichotomize toxicity outcomes based on the pre-specified dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria. This loss of information is particularly inefficient due to the small sample sizes in phase I trials. Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAEv3.0) classify adverse events into grades 1-5, which range from 1 as a mild adverse event to 5 as death related to an adverse event. In this paper, we extend the CRM to include ordinal toxicity outcomes as specified by CTCAEv3.0 using the proportional odds model (POM) and compare results with the dichotomous CRM. A sensitivity analysis of the new design compares various target DLT rates, sample sizes, and cohort sizes. This design is also assessed under various dose-toxicity relationship models including POMs as well as those that violate the proportional odds assumption. A simulation study shows that the proportional odds CRM performs as well as the dichotomous CRM on all criteria compared (including safety criteria such as percentage of patients treated at highly toxic or suboptimal dose levels) and with improved estimation of the maximum tolerated dose when the PO assumption is not violated. These findings suggest that it is beneficial to incorporate ordinal toxicity endpoints into phase I trial designs.},

	shorttitle = {{TAME}},
	doi = {10.1016/S1470-2045(07)70144-4},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to examine deficiencies in established methods of summarising adverse events, and to create a new reporting system (TAME) for summarising the toxicity burden of cancer treatment. TAME consolidates traditional adverse-event data into three risk domains: short-term (acute) Toxicity (T), Adverse long-term (late) effects (A), and Mortality risk (M) generated by a treatment programme (E=End results); and assigns treatments to risk classes for each risk domain.
METHODS: We examined formally an established method for summarising adverse events (the max-grade method) in five trials of patients with head and neck cancer done between September, 1991, and August, 2000, by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) that involved 13 treatment groups (2304 patients). We calculated TAME summary metrics that included time and multiplicity factors in the same patient groups. We compared relative T values with relative values for toxic effects from the max-grade approach. We also calculated the range of individual patient T scores in two groups from one of the trials (the laryngeal-preservation trial).
RESULTS: The max-grade method systematically excluded 29-70\% of total reported high-grade (grade 3-4) acute adverse events, contained progressive bias, and favoured higher toxicity programmes. Relative T values in the 13 treatment programmes tested showed an increase of almost 500\% in acute toxicity burden (100-590) between treatment groups compared with a 170\% increase (100-270) between treatment groups by use of the max-grade method. The difference between these two summary systems was statistically significant (mean difference -102 [95\% CI -167 to -37], p=0.005, t test for paired differences). Four risk classes were designated for acute and relative late effects: low (100-140), moderate (150-390), high (400-490), and extreme ({\textgreater}or=500). The distribution of individual patient T scores showed that 82 (60\%) patients who received concurrent platinum-radiotherapy for larynx preservation reported two or more high-grade events, and 34 (20\%) reported four or more high-grade events; these findings differed significantly from the distribution of individual patient T scores for patients who received radiotherapy alone, in which 32 (19\%) reported two or more high-grade events and 3 (3\%) reported four or more high-grade events (p{\textless}0.0001). The max-grade method also systematically excluded 26-48\% of high-grade (grade 3-4) late adverse events. However, less variation was noted in the relative risk of late events (100-270) by the TAME method for late effects.
INTERPRETATION: Traditional methods for summarising adverse events systematically exclude important data, giving an inaccurate impression of the toxicity burden in complex multimodality trials. By contrast, T values use data on all high-grade adverse events. T values are proportional to the intensity of treatment, showing a 500\% increase between treatment groups in acute toxicity burden in RTOG trials of head and neck cancer done during this study interval. TAME reporting provides a concise and uniform method to compare relative risk among treatment options. Future studies should include testing the performance of the TAME system in additional datasets (from different research organisations and disease sites), prospective correlation of TAME endpoints with predefined outcome measures, and assessment of its usefulness in clinical decision making.},

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has significant clinical activity in diverse cancer classes and can induce durable remissions in even refractory advanced disease. However, only a minority of cancer patients treated with ICB have long-term benefits, and ICB treatment is associated with significant, potentially life-threatening, autoimmune side effects. There is a great need to develop biomarkers of response to guide patient selection to maximize the chance of benefit and prevent unnecessary toxicity, and current biomarkers do not have optimal positive or negative predictive value. A variety of potential biomarkers are currently being developed, including those based on assessment of checkpoint protein expression, evaluation of tumor-intrinsic features including mutation burden and viral infection, evaluation of features of the tumor immune microenvironment including nature of immune cell infiltration, and features of the host such as composition of the gut microbiome. Better understanding of the underlying fundamental mechanisms of immune response and resistance to ICB, along with the use of complementary assays that interrogate distinct features of the tumor, the tumor microenvironment, and host immune system, will allow more precise use of these therapies to optimize patient outcomes.

Trials of this type are carried out to determine whether a dose can be found that balances the risks of each complication. Three different scenarios describing potential relationships between each risk and the treatment dose are postulated. The scenarios encompass both favorable situations in which several acceptable doses exist and unfavorable situations in which no acceptable dose exists. The operating characteristics of three sequentially developed trial designs were examined by simulation under each dose-response scenario. The first design was derived from seemingly reasonable rules, but simulations showed that performance fell far short of what was desired, thus motivating modifications. Subsequent designs showed improved performance characteristics compared to the original design. Without close examination of the operating characteristics, the original design would have been implemented, leading to high risk of an erroneous conclusion.},

Using a genome-wide loss-of-function screen, we identified that impaired death receptor signaling in ALL led to rapidly progressive disease despite CART19 treatment. This was mediated by an inherent resistance to T cell cytotoxicity which permitted antigen persistence and was subsequently magnified by the induction of CAR T cell functional impairment. These findings were validated using samples from two CAR T cell clinical trials in ALL, where we found that reduced expression of death receptor genes was associated with worse overall survival and reduced T cell fitness. Our findings suggest that inherent dysregulation of death receptor signaling in ALL directly leads to CAR T cell failure by impairing T cell cytotoxicity and promoting progressive CAR T cell dysfunction.},

	abstract = {Objective: Patients enrolling on Phase I/II trials, together with their oncology investigators, face decision-problems neglected by current trial designs. Hitherto, early-phase oncology trial designs have privileged statistical formalism and algorithmic rigidity, abstracting clinical judgment exercise away from investigators. 'Achieving' such abstraction apparently requires dichotomizing complex toxicities and responses, and ignoring optimal-dose heterogeneity. The recent advent of pragmatic phase 1 dose-titration designs, however, facilitates restoring primacy to clinical judgment and the individual patient. Herein, we generalize one such design to incorporate measures of therapeutic response, exemplifying a '4P' concept of Patient centered, Physician Investigator friendly Pragmatic Phase I/II trial design. Methods: We start from crucial questions early-phase trial participants ask their oncologists during on-trial follow-up, and treat these as defining 'use cases' for a synoptic graphical 'dashboard'. Building upon a previously described visualization, we prototype a data graphic fulfilling these use cases. Results: Three characteristic questions arise: (1) Have you found signs my cancer is or isn't responding to the study drug? (2) How does my experience compare with other patients in this trial? (3) Should I keep taking the drug at my current dose, or should we change the dose—or stop it? Questions (1–2) constitute use cases for a 'swimmer plot' linked to the dose-titration diagram. Question 3 underscores the imperative to maintain an up-to-date titration heuristic, incorporating any emerging evidence linking drug-exposure measures (including on-target toxicities) with clinical response. This latter consideration prompts addition of response-vs-exposure plots in which both absolute dose and grade of on-target toxicity appear as covariates. Conclusion: Our clinically realistic dashboard illuminates a '4P' concept that restores patient-centered decision making to its rightful status in early-phase oncology trials. By accentuating crucial decision-problems faced by early-phase cancer trial participants and their oncologists, this model should help methodologists to propose useful adjunctive formal decision supports.},

During a prespecified fixed follow-up period, the times to disease progression, toxicity, and death are monitored continuously, and an ordinal disease status variable, including progressive disease (PD) as one level, is evaluated repeatedly by scheduled imaging. We assume a proportional hazards model with piecewise constant baseline hazard for each continuous variable and a longitudinal multinomial probit model for the ordinal disease status process and include multivariate patient frailties to induce association among the outcomes. A finite partition of the nonfatal outcome combinations during the follow-up period is constructed, and the utility of each set in the partition is elicited. Posterior mean utility is used to optimize each patient's dose, subject to a safety rule excluding doses with an unacceptably high rate of PD, severe toxicity, or death. A simulation study shows that, compared with the proposed design, a simpler design based on commonly used efficacy and toxicity outcomes obtained by combining the four variables described above performs poorly and has substantially smaller probabilities of correctly choosing truly optimal doses and excluding truly unsafe doses.},

	abstract = {Background Building on earlier work, the toxicity probability interval (TPI) method,                 we present a modified TPI (mTPI) design that is calibration-free for phase I trials.                 Purpose Our goal is to improve the trial conduct and provide more effective designs                 while maintaining the simplicity of the original TPI design., Methods Like the TPI method, the mTPI consists of a practical dose-finding scheme                 guided by the posterior inference for a simple Bayesian model. However, the new                 method proposes improved dose-finding decision rules based on a new statistic, the                 unit probability mass (UPM). For a given interval and a probability distribution,                 the UPM is defined as the ratio of the probability mass of the interval to the                 length of the interval., Results The improvement through the use of the UPM for dose finding is threefold: (1)                 the mTPI method appears to be safer than the TPI method in that it puts fewer                 patients on toxic doses; (2) the mTPI method eliminates the need for calibrating two                 key parameters, which is required in the TPI method and is a known difficult issue;                 and (3) the mTPI method corresponds to the Bayes rule under a decision theoretic                 framework and possesses additional desirable large- and small-sample properties., Limitation The proposed method is applicable to dose-finding trials with a binary                 toxicity endpoint., Conclusion The new method mTPI is essentially calibration free and exhibits improved                 performance over the TPI method. These features make the mTPI a desirable choice for                 the design of practical trials. Clinical Trials 2010; 7: 653—663.                 http://ctj.sagepub.com},

	doi = {10.1177/1740774520932130},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: In oncology, new combined treatments make it difficult to order dose levels according to monotonically increasing toxicity. New flexible dose-finding designs that take into account uncertainty in dose levels ordering were compared with classical designs through simulations in the setting of the monotonicity assumption violation. We give recommendations for the choice of dose-finding design.
METHODS: Motivated by a clinical trial for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, we considered designs that require a monotonicity assumption, the Bayesian Continual Reassessment Method, the modified Toxicity Probability Interval, the Bayesian Optimal Interval design, and designs that relax monotonicity assumption, the Bayesian Partial Ordering Continual Reassessment Method and the No Monotonicity Assumption design. We considered 15 scenarios including monotonic and non-monotonic dose-toxicity relationships among six dose levels.
RESULTS: The No Monotonicity Assumption and Partial Ordering Continual Reassessment Method designs were robust to the violation of the monotonicity assumption. Under non-monotonic scenarios, the No Monotonicity Assumption design selected the correct dose level more often than alternative methods on average. Under the majority of monotonic scenarios, the Partial Ordering Continual Reassessment Method selected the correct dose level more often than the No Monotonicity Assumption design. Other designs were impacted by the violation of the monotonicity assumption with a proportion of correct selections below 20\% in most scenarios. Under monotonic scenarios, the highest proportions of correct selections were achieved using the Continual Reassessment Method and the Bayesian Optimal Interval design (between 52.8\% and 73.1\%). The costs of relaxing the monotonicity assumption by the No Monotonicity Assumption design and Partial Ordering Continual Reassessment Method were decreases in the proportions of correct selections under monotonic scenarios ranging from 5.3\% to 20.7\% and from 1.4\% to 16.1\%, respectively, compared with the best performing design and were higher proportions of patients allocated to toxic dose levels during the trial.
CONCLUSIONS: Innovative oncology treatments may no longer follow monotonic dose levels ordering which makes standard phase I methods fail. In such a setting, appropriate designs, as the No Monotonicity Assumption or Partial Ordering Continual Reassessment Method designs, should be used to safely determine recommended for phase II dose.},

              Background
              Phase I oncology trials are often regarded as a therapeutic option for patients. However, such claims have relied on surrogate measures of benefit, such as objective response.
            
            
              Methods
               Using a systematic search of publications, we assessed the therapeutic value of phase I cancer trial participation by determining the probability that patients will receive active doses of treatments that eventually receive FDA approval or a National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline recommendation for their indication. ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, American Society of Clinical Oncology reports, NCCN guidelines, and Drugs@FDA were searched between May 1, 2018, and July 31, 2018. All statistical tests were 2-sided.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 1000 phase I oncology trials initiated between 2005 and 2010 and enrolling 32 582 patients were randomly sampled from 3229 eligible trials on ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 386 (1.2\%) patients received a treatment that was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for their malignancy at a dose delivered in the trial; including NCCN guideline recommendations, the number and proportion are 1168 (3.6\%). Meta-regression showed a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients receiving a drug that was ultimately FDA approved in biomarker trials (rate ratio = 4.49, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.53 to 13.23; P = .006) and single-indication trials (rate ratio = 3.32, 95\% CI = 1.21 to 9.15; P  = .02); proportions were statistically significantly lower for combination vs monotherapy trials (rate ratio = 0.09, 95\% CI = 0.01 to 0.68; P  = .02).
            
            
              Conclusions
              One in 83 patients in phase I cancer trials received a treatment that was approved for their indication at the doses received. Given published estimates of serious adverse event rates of 10\%-19\%, this represents low therapeutic value for phase I trial participation.},

            Background: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a clinically validated therapeutic target for the imaging and treatment of mCRPC. AMG 160 is an HLE BiTE immune therapy designed to redirect T cells to cancer cells by binding to PSMA on cancer cells and CD3 on T cells. BiTE immune therapy leads to direct tumor cell killing, T-cell activation and expansion, and the creation of a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Combining AMG 160 with a PD-1 inhibitor may enhance antitumor activity by enabling sustained T-cell-dependent killing of tumor cells in the inflamed tumor microenvironment. Methods: NCT03792841 is a phase I study of AMG 160 as monotherapy (part 1) and in combination with pembrolizumab (part 2) in men with histologically/cytologically confirmed mCRPC who are refractory to a novel hormonal therapy (abiraterone, enzalutamide, and/or apalutamide) and have failed 1–2 taxane regimens (or are medically unsuitable or have refused taxanes), who have ongoing castration with total serum testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dL, and have evidence of progressive disease. Patients who received prior PSMA radionuclide therapy may be eligible. Patients with CNS metastases, leptomeningeal disease, spinal cord compression, or active autoimmune disease will be excluded. Primary objectives are to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of AMG 160 given as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab. Secondary objectives are to characterize pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity. Exploratory objectives include evaluation of potential pharmacodynamic and patient selection biomarkers, immunogenicity, and patient-reported pain and functional outcomes. The part 1 dose exploration will determine the MTD/RP2D of AMG 160. The part 1 dose expansion will confirm the safety and tolerability of the MTD/RP2D. The part 2 dose exploration will estimate the MTD/RP2D of AMG 160 in combination with pembrolizumab. Evaluation of preliminary antitumor activity will be based on RECIST 1.1 with Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 modifications, PSA response, CTC response, progression-free survival (radiographic and PSA), and overall survival. PSMA PET/CT and FDG PET/CT imaging will be used for evaluation of exploratory objectives. The study opened in February 2019 and is currently recruiting patients into both part 1 and part 2.

	abstract = {The commonplace description of phase 1 clinical trials in oncology as "primarily concerned with safety" is belied by their near universal adoption of dose-escalation practices which are inherently unsafe. In contrast with dose titration, cohort-wise dose escalation regards patients as exchangeable, an indefensible assumption in the face of widely appreciated inter-individual heterogeneity in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PKPD). I have previously advanced this argument in terms of a precautionary coherence principle that brings the well-known coherence notion of Cheung (2005) into contact with modern imperatives of patient-centeredness and precision dosing. Here, however, I explore these matters in some mechanistic detail by analyzing a trial of the bispecific T cell engager AFM11, in which a fatal toxicity occurred. To this end, I develop a Bayesian dose-response model for a single ordinal toxicity. By constructing this model's priors to align with the AFM11 trial as designed and conducted, I demonstrate the incompatibility of that design with any reasonable expectation of safety. Indeed, the model readily yields prospective estimates of toxic response probabilities that suggest the fatality in this trial could have been foreseen as likely.},

	abstract = {Background:
              As progress continues in oncology drug development, this study aimed to examine whether the previously established association between drug dose and efficacy in the era of cytotoxic therapies remains true in today’s phase I dose-escalation oncology trials.
              Methods:
              A systematic review of early-phase dose-finding trials of single-agent oncology drugs from 2015 to 2018 was conducted to examine the relationship between drug dose and objective responses. Cancer-specific trials were included if they determined maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Data related to the study drug, study design, treatment response, cancer type, dose levels, MTD, and RP2D were all collected. Dose level was categorized into 4 categories (≤40\%, 41\%–80\%, 81\%–120\%, and {\textgreater}120\% of the RP2D) and was further analyzed by class of drug.
              Results:
              A total of 175 phase I studies were identified, with a total of 7,330 patients showing a median response rate of 5\% (range, 0\%–83\%) across trials. A total of 93 trials with 2,506 participants had response data corresponding to drug dose level. In this subset, the median response rate was 5\% (range, 0\%–83\%) across trials. Across all participants in this subset, the response rate was 12\% (57 of 491) among those in the dose range of ≤40\% of RP2D, 17\% (95 of 562) among those in 41\% to 80\% of RP2D, 23\% (272 of 1,206) among those in 81\% to 120\% of RP2D, and 29\% (71 of 247) among those in {\textgreater}120\% of RP2D (
              P
              {\textless}.001). The response rate at ≤40\% of RP2D for targeted antibody was 5\%, 4\% for cellular therapy, 19\% for immunotherapy, and 21\% for small-molecule targeted inhibitors.
              Conclusions:
              Whereas our study of published phase I trials continued to show a low response rate consistent with earlier studies, the relationship between response and dose does not always peak at 81\% to 120\% of RP2D anymore, likely due to the use of novel immunotherapy and targeted agents with distinct efficacy and toxicity patterns.},

	abstract = {The overwhelming majority of dose-escalation clinical trials use methods that seek a maximum tolerable dose, including rule-based methods like the 3+3, and model-based methods like CRM and EWOC. These methods assume that the incidences of efficacy and toxicity always increase as dose is increased. This assumption is widely accepted with cytotoxic therapies. In recent decades, however, the search for novel cancer treatments has broadened, increasingly focusing on inhibitors and antibodies. The rationale that higher doses are always associated with superior efficacy is less clear for these types of therapies. We extracted dose-level efficacy and toxicity outcomes from 115 manuscripts reporting dose-finding clinical trials in cancer between 2008 and 2014. We analysed the outcomes from each manuscript using flexible non-linear regression models to investigate the evidence supporting the monotonic efficacy and toxicity assumptions. We found that the monotonic toxicity assumption was well-supported across most treatment classes and disease areas. In contrast, we found very little evidence supporting the monotonic efficacy assumption. Our conclusion is that dose-escalation trials routinely use methods whose assumptions are violated by the outcomes observed. As a consequence, dose-finding trials risk recommending unjustifiably high doses that are harmful to patients. We recommend that trialists consider experimental designs that allow toxicity and efficacy outcomes to jointly determine the doses given to patients and recommended for further study.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementKristian Brock is funded by the University of Birmingham.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This research collates previously published data and requires no IRB / oversight approval.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

However, despite a number of recent enhancements to the method, its acceptance in actual clinical practice has been hampered by several practical difficulties. In this paper, we consider several further refinements in the context of phase I oncology trials. In particular, we allow the trial to stop when the width of the posterior 95 per cent probability interval for the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) becomes sufficiently narrow (that is, when the information accumulating from the trial data reaches a prespecified level). We employ a simulation study to evaluate five such stopping rules under three alternative states of prior knowledge regarding the MTD (accurate, too low and too high). Our results suggest our adaptive designs preserve the CRM's estimation ability while offering the possibility of earlier stopping of the trial.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models are routinely calibrated to experimental data, with goals ranging from building predictive models to quantifying parameters that cannot be measured. Whether or not reliable parameter estimates are obtainable from the available data can easily be overlooked. Such issues of parameter identifiability have important ramifications for both the predictive power of a model, and the mechanistic insight that can be obtained. Identifiability analysis is well-established for deterministic, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, but there are no commonly-adopted methods for analysing identifiability in stochastic models. We provide an accessible introduction to identifiability analysis and demonstrate how existing ideas for analysis of ODE models can be applied to stochastic differential equation (SDE) models through four practical case studies. To assess structural identifiability, we study a system of ODEs that describe the statistical moments of the stochastic process using the open-source software tool \&lt;tt\&gt;DAISY\&lt;/tt\&gt;. Using practically-motivated synthetic data and Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, we assess parameter identifiability in the context of available data. Our analysis shows that SDE models can often extract more information about parameters than deterministic descriptions. All code used to perform the analysis is available (https://github.com/ap-browning/SDE-Identifiability)Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel (CTL019) has an 81\% response rate in children with relapsed or chemotherapy refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a life-threatening treatment-related toxicity that limits the full therapeutic potential in adults. We report outcomes for adults with r/r ALL treated with an optimized CTL019 dosing and CRS management strategy.
METHODS: Adults with r/r B-cell ALL received CTL019 in 1 of 2 trials. Patients received lymphodepletion followed by CTL019 as either a one-time infusion or fractionated infusions split over 3 days (day 1, 10\%; day 2, 30\%; day 3, 60\%), which allowed for day 2 and day 3 doses to be held for early CRS. Total planned CTL019 dose varied with adaptive protocol modifications in response to efficacy and CRS toxicity.
RESULTS: Thirty-five adults with r/r ALL received CTL019 in 1 of 3 dosing cohorts. The low-dose cohort (n = 9) received single or fractionated dosing and had manageable toxicity with a 33\% complete remission (CR) rate. In the high-dose single infusion cohort, 3 of 6 patients with refractory CRS concurrent with culture-positive sepsis died, and 3 achieved CR. The 20 patients in the high-dose fractionated (HDF) cohort had a 90\% CR rate and manageable CRS. The HDF cohort had the highest survival, with a 2-year overall survival of 73\% (95\% CI, 46\% to 88\%) and event-free survival of 49.5\% (95\% CI, 21\% to 73\%).
CONCLUSION: Fractionated dosing of CTL019 with intrapatient dose modification optimizes safety without compromising efficacy in adults with r/r ALL.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: AT13148 is an oral AGC kinase inhibitor, which potently inhibits ROCK and AKT kinases. In preclinical models, AT13148 has been shown to have anti-metastatic and anti-proliferative activity.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The trial followed a rolling six design during dose escalation. An intra-patient dose escalation arm to evaluate tolerability and a biopsy cohort to study pharmacodynamic (PD) effects were later added. AT13148 was administered orally three days a week (Mon-Wed-Fri) in 28-day cycles. Pharmacokinetic profiles were assessed using mass spectrometry and PD studies included quantifying p-GSK3β levels in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and p-cofilin, p-MLC2 levels in tumor biopsies.
RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were treated on study. The safety of 5 - 300 mg of AT13148 was studied. Further, the doses of 120-180-240 mg were studied in an intra-patient dose escalation cohort. The dose-limiting toxicities included hypotension (300 mg), pneumonitis and elevated liver enzymes (240 mg) and skin rash (180 mg). The most common side effects were fatigue, nausea, headaches and hypotension. Based on tolerability 180 mg was considered the maximally tolerated dose. At 180 mg, mean Cmax and AUC were 383 nM and 13399 nM.h, respectively. At 180 mg, ≥50\% reduction of p-cofilin was observed in 3/8 post-treatment biopsies.
CONCLUSIONS: AT13148 was the first dual potent ROCK-AKT inhibitor to be investigated for the treatment of solid tumors. The narrow therapeutic index and the pharmacokinetic profile led to recommend not developing this compound further. There are significant lessons learned in designing and testing agents that simultaneously inhibit multiple kinases including AGC kinases in cancer.},

Dosing is particularly important for diseases and/or drugs where the drug can decrease severe morbidity or prolong life. Likewise, dosing is important where the drug can cause death or severe morbidity. Since we believe there are many examples where more precise dosing could benefit patients, it is worthwhile to consider how to prioritize drug-disease targets. One key consideration is the quality of information available from which more precise dosing recommendations can be constructed. When a new more precise dosing scheme is created and differs significantly from the approved label, it is important to consider the level of proof necessary to either change the label and/or change clinical practice. The cost and effort needed to provide this proof should also be considered in prioritizing drug-disease precision dosing targets. Although precision dosing is being promoted and has great promise, it is underutilized in many drugs and disease states. Therefore, we believe it is important to consider how more precise dosing is going to be delivered to high priority patients in a timely manner. If better dosing schemes do not change clinical practice resulting in better patient outcomes, then what is the use? This review paper discusses variables to consider when prioritizing precision dosing candidates while highlighting key examples of precision dosing that have been successfully used to improve patient care.},

In recent decades, technological advances have enabled patients to receive more targeted doses of radiation to the tumor, with sparing of adjacent normal tissues. There had been hope that the era of precision medicine would enhance the combination of radiotherapy with targeted anticancer drugs; however, this ambition remains to be realized. In view of this lack of progress, the FDA-AACR-ASTRO Clinical Development of Drug-Radiotherapy Combinations Workshop was held in February 2018 to bring together stakeholders and opinion leaders from academia, clinical radiation oncology, industry, patient advocacy groups, and the FDA to discuss challenges to introducing new drug-radiotherapy combinations to the clinic. This Perspectives in Regulatory Science and Policy article summarizes the themes and action points that were discussed. Intelligent trial design is required to increase the number of studies that efficiently meet their primary outcomes; endpoints to be considered include local control, organ preservation, and patient-reported outcomes. Novel approaches including immune-oncology or DNA-repair inhibitor agents combined with radiotherapy should be prioritized. In this article, we focus on how the regulatory challenges associated with defining a new drug-radiotherapy combination can be overcome to improve clinical outcomes for patients with cancer.},

	abstract = {Misgivings have been raised about the operating characteristics of the canonical 3+3 dose-escalation phase I clinical trial design. Yet, the traditional 3+3 design is still the most commonly used. Although it has been implied that adhering to this design is due to a stubborn reluctance to adopt change despite other designs performing better in hypothetical computer-generated simulation models, the continued adherence to 3+3 dose-escalation phase I strategies is more likely because these designs perform the best in the real world, pinpointing the correct dose and important side effects with an acceptable degree of precision. Beyond statistical simulations, there are little data to refute the supposed shortcomings ascribed to the 3+3 method. Even so, to address the unique nuances of gene- and immune-targeted compounds, a variety of inventive phase 1 trial designs have been suggested. Strategies for developing these therapies have launched first-in-human studies devised to acquire a breadth of patient data that far exceed the size of a typical phase I design and blur the distinction between dose selection and efficacy evaluation. Recent phase I trials of promising cancer therapies assessed objective tumor response and durability at various doses and schedules as well as incorporated multiple expansion cohorts spanning a variety of histology or biomarker-defined tumor subtypes, sometimes resulting in U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval after phase I. This article reviews recent innovations in phase I design from the perspective of multiple stakeholders and provides recommendations for future trials.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12885-020-07703-6},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The continual reassessment method (CRM) identifies the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) more efficiently and identifies the true MTD more frequently compared to standard methods such as the 3 + 3 method. An initial estimate of the dose-toxicity relationship (prior skeleton) is required, and there is limited guidance on how to select this. Previously, we compared the CRM with six different skeletons to the 3 + 3 method by conducting post-hoc analysis on a phase 1 oncology study (AZD3514), each CRM model reduced the number of patients allocated to suboptimal and toxic doses. This manuscript extends this work by assessing the ability of the 3 + 3 method and the CRM with different skeletons in determining the true MTD of various "true" dose-toxicity relationships.
METHODS: One thousand studies were simulated for each "true" dose toxicity relationship considered, four were based on clinical trial data (AZD3514, AZD1208, AZD1480, AZD4877), and four were theoretical. The 3 + 3 method and 2-stage extended CRM with six skeletons were applied to identify the MTD, where the true MTD was considered as the largest dose where the probability of experiencing a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is ≤33\%.
RESULTS: For every true dose-toxicity relationship, the CRM selected the MTD that matched the true MTD in a higher proportion of studies compared to the 3 + 3 method. The CRM overestimated the MTD in a higher proportion of simulations compared to the 3 + 3 method. The proportion of studies where the correct MTD was selected varied considerably between skeletons. For some true dose-toxicity relationships, some skeletons identified the true MTD in a higher proportion of scenarios compared to the skeleton that matched the true dose-toxicity relationship.
CONCLUSION: Through simulation, the CRM generally outperformed the 3 + 3 method for the clinical and theoretical true dose-toxicity relationships. It was observed that accurate estimates of the true skeleton do not always outperform a generic skeleton, therefore the application of wide confidence intervals may enable a generic skeleton to be used. Further work is needed to determine the optimum skeleton.},

	abstract = {One of the key objectives of oncology first-in-human trials has often been to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). However, targeted therapies might not exhibit dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) at doses significantly higher than sufficiently active doses, and there is frequently a limited ability to objectively quantify adverse events. Thus, while MTD-based determination of recommended phase II dose may have yielded appropriate dosing for some cytotoxics, targeted therapeutics (including monoclonal antibodies and/or immunotherapies) sometimes need alternative or complementary strategies to help identify dose ranges for a randomized dose-ranging study. One complementary strategy is to define a biologically efficacious dose (BED) using an "effect marker." An effect marker could be a target engagement, pharmacodynamic, or disease progression marker (change in tumor size for solid tumors or bone marrow blast count for some hematologic tumors). Although the concept of BED has been discussed extensively, we review specific examples in which the approach influenced oncology clinical development. Data extracted from the literature and the examples support improving dose selection strategies to benefit patients, providers, and the biopharmaceutical industry. Although the examples illustrate key contributions of effect markers in dose selection, no one-size-fits-all approach to dosing can be justified. Higher-than-optimal dosing can increase toxicity in later trials (and in clinical use), which can have a negative impact on efficacy (via lower adherence or direct sequelae of toxicities). Proper dose selection in oncology should follow a multifactorial decision process leading to a randomized, dose-ranging study instead of a single phase II dose.},

We demonstrate that the normalization process prunes immature vessels and improves the integrity and function of the remaining vasculature by enhancing the perivascular cell and basement membrane coverage. We also show that DC101 induces a hydrostatic pressure gradient across the vascular wall, which leads to a deeper penetration of molecules into tumors. Thus, vascular normalization may contribute to the improved survival rates in tumor-bearing animals and in colorectal carcinoma patients treated with an anti-VEGF antibody in combination with cytotoxic therapies.},

	abstract = {Many Prolog programs are unnecessarily impure because of inadequate means to express syntactic inequality. While the frequently provided built-in `dif/2` is able to correctly describe expected answers, its direct use in programs often leads to overly complex and inefficient definitions --- mainly due to the lack of adequate indexing mechanisms. We propose to overcome these problems by using a new predicate that subsumes both equality and inequality via reification. Code complexity is reduced with a monotonic, higher-order if-then-else construct based on `call/N`. For comparable correct uses of impure definitions, our approach is as determinate and similarly efficient as its impure counterparts.},

	doi = {10.1101/240846},
	abstract = {Background Coherence notions have a long history in statistics, as rhetorical devices that support the critical examination of statistical doctrines and practices. Within the special domain of dose-finding methodology, a widely-discussed coherence criterion has been advanced as a means to guard the conceptual integrity of formal dose-finding designs from ad hoc tinkering. This is not, however, the only possible coherence criterion relevant to dose finding. Indeed, a new coherence criterion emerges naturally when the near-universal practice of cohort-wise dose escalation is examined from a clinical perspective.Methods The practice of enrolling drug-naive patients into an escalation cohort is considered from a realistic perspective that acknowledges patients’ heterogeneity with respect to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. A new coherence criterion thereby emerges, requiring that an escalation dose be tried preferentially in participants who have already tolerated a lower dose, rather than in new enrollees who are drug-naive. The logical implications of this ‘precautionary coherence’ (PC) criterion are worked out in the setting of a 3+3 design. A ‘3+3/PC’ design that satisfies this criterion is described and visualized. A simulation study is performed, evaluating the long-run performance of this new design, relative to optimal 1-size-fits-all dosing.Results Under the PC criterion, the 3+3 dose-escalation design necessarily transmutes into a dose titration design. Two simple rules suffice to enable abandonment of low starting doses, and termination of escalation. The process of conducting the 3+3/PC trial itself models the application of a dose titration algorithm (DTA) that carries over readily into clinical care. The 3+3/PC trial also yields an interval-censored ‘dose-survival curve’ having a semantics that should prove familiar to oncology trialists. Simulated 3+3/PC trials yield DTAs over a median of 6 dose levels, achieving 50\% improved population-level efficacy compared to optimal 1-size-fits-all dosing.Conclusions Dose individualization can be accomplished within a trial conducted along ‘algorithmic’ lines resembling those of the inveterate 3+3 design. The dose-survival curve arising from this ‘3+3/PC’ design has semantics that should prove familiar and conceptually accessible to oncology trialists, and also seems capable of supporting more formal statistical treatments of the design. In the presence of sufficient heterogeneity in individualized optimal dosing, a 3+3/PC trial outperforms any conceivable 1-size-fits-all dose-finding design. This fact eliminates the rationale for the latter designs, and should put an end to the further development and promulgation of 1-size-fits-all dose finding.},

The BCMA-CD3 BsAb was safe and efficacious in a subset of mice, but failed in those with high-tumor burden, consistent with clinical reports of BsAb in leukemia. The combination of BCMA-CD3 BsAb with pomalidomide expanded lytic T cells and improved activity even in IMiD resistant high-tumor burden cases. Yet, survival was only marginally extended due to acute toxicity and T cell exhaustion, which impaired T cell persistence. In contrast, the combination with cyclophosphamide was safe and allowed for a tempered pro-inflammatory response associated with long-lasting complete remission. Concurrent cytotoxic therapy with BsAb actually improved T cell persistence and function, offering a promising approach to patients with a large tumor burden.},

Computational details are given and the proposed design is compared to existing designs in a simulation study.

However, the first result proved here is that this goal is infeasible, and that such designs, and, more generally, designs that concentrate on one dose from some time on, cannot provide consistent estimators for the MTD unless very strong parametric assumptions hold. Allowing some non-MTD treatment, we construct a randomized design that assigns the MTD with probability that approaches one as the size of the experiment goes to infinity and estimates the MTD consistently. We compare the suggested design with several methods by simulations, studying their performances in terms of correct estimation of the MTD and the proportion of individuals treated with the MTD.},

The size of the window within which the current dose will be repeated is obtained based on the theory of Markov chains as applied to group up-and-down designs. But whereas the treatment allocation rule in Markovian group up-and-down designs is only based on information from the current cohort of subjects, the treatment allocation rule for the proposed design is based on the cumulative information at the current dose.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The continual reassessment method (CRM) is an adaptive model-based design used to estimate the maximum tolerated dose in dose finding clinical trials. A way to evaluate the sensitivity of a given CRM model including the functional form of the dose-toxicity curve, the prior distribution on the model parameter, and the initial guesses of toxicity probability at each dose is using indifference intervals. While the indifference interval technique provides a succinct summary of model sensitivity, there are infinitely many possible ways to specify the initial guesses of toxicity probability. In practice, these are generally specified by trial and error through extensive simulations.
METHODS: By using indifference intervals, the initial guesses used in the CRM can be selected by specifying a range of acceptable toxicity probabilities in addition to the target probability of toxicity. An algorithm is proposed for obtaining the indifference interval that maximizes the average percentage of correct selection across a set of scenarios of true probabilities of toxicity and providing a systematic approach for selecting initial guesses in a much less time-consuming manner than the trial-and-error method. The methods are compared in the context of two real CRM trials.
RESULTS: For both trials, the initial guesses selected by the proposed algorithm had similar operating characteristics as measured by percentage of correct selection, average absolute difference between the true probability of the dose selected and the target probability of toxicity, percentage treated at each dose and overall percentage of toxicity compared to the initial guesses used during the conduct of the trials which were obtained by trial and error through a time-consuming calibration process. The average percentage of correct selection for the scenarios considered were 61.5 and 62.0\% in the lymphoma trial, and 62.9 and 64.0\% in the stroke trial for the trial-and-error method versus the proposed approach.
LIMITATIONS: We only present detailed results for the empiric dose toxicity curve, although the proposed methods are applicable for other dose-toxicity models such as the logistic.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method provides a fast and systematic approach for selecting initial guesses of probabilities of toxicity used in the CRM that are competitive to those obtained by trial and error through a time-consuming process, thus, simplifying the model calibration process for the CRM.},

This paper examines, through a simulation study, the sensitivity of CRM both to the initial modelling of the dose-toxicity relationship and the prior. It appears that the performance of CRM can be improved by using vague priors and initial tuning of the model to allow flexibility.},

Asymptotically, the method has been shown to select the correct dose given that certain conditions are satisfied. When sample size is small, specifying a reasonable model is important. While an algorithm has been proposed for the calibration of the initial guesses of the probabilities of toxicity, the calibration of the prior distribution of the parameter for the Bayesian CRM has not been addressed. In this paper, we introduce the concept of least informative prior variance for a normal prior distribution. We also propose two systematic approaches to jointly calibrate the prior variance and the initial guesses of the probability of toxicity at each dose. The proposed calibration approaches are compared with existing approaches in the context of two examples via simulations. The new approaches and the previously proposed methods yield very similar results since the latter used appropriate vague priors. However, the new approaches yield a smaller interval of toxicity probabilities in which a neighboring dose may be selected.},

PRO usage increased over time, from 0.6\% (trials initiated before 2000) to 3.4\% (trials starting between 2015 and 2019). The most common PRO measures were unspecified (29\%), tumor-specific (24\%), and generic cancer (19\%).
CONCLUSION: Although uncommon in phase I oncology clinical trials, PRO usage is increasing over time. PRO measures were often unspecified on ClinicalTrials.gov, suggesting that more precise reporting and standardization are needed.},

	abstract = {Background:
              As our understanding of the etiology and mechanisms of cancer becomes more sophisticated and the number of therapeutic options increases, phase I oncology trials today have multiple primary objectives. Many such designs are now “seamless,” meaning that the trial estimates both the maximum tolerated dose and the efficacy at this dose level. Sponsors often proceed with further study only with this additional efficacy evidence. However, with this increasing complexity in trial design, it becomes challenging to articulate fundamental operating characteristics of these trials, such as (1) what is the probability that the design will identify an acceptable, that is., safe and efficacious, dose level? or (2) how many patients will be assigned to an acceptable dose level on average?
            
            
              Methods:
              In this manuscript, we propose a new modular framework for designing and evaluating seamless oncology trials. Each module is comprised of either a dose assignment step or a dose-response evaluation, and multiple such modules can be implemented sequentially. We develop modules from existing phase I/II designs as well as a novel module for evaluating dose-response using a Bayesian isotonic regression scheme.
            
            
              Results:
              We also demonstrate a freely available R package called seamlesssim to numerically estimate, by means of simulation, the operating characteristics of these modular trials.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Together, this design framework and its accompanying simulator allow the clinical trialist to compare multiple different candidate designs, more rigorously assess performance, better justify sample sizes, and ultimately select a higher quality design.},

	doi = {10.1002/sim.7095},
	abstract = {Drug combination therapy has become the mainstream approach to cancer treatment. One fundamental feature that makes combination trials different from single-agent trials is the existence of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) contour, that is, multiple MTDs. As a result, unlike single-agent phase I trials, which aim to find a single MTD, it is often of interest to find the MTD contour for combination trials. We propose a new dose-finding design, the waterfall design, to find the MTD contour for drug combination trials. Taking the divide-and-conquer strategy, the waterfall design divides the task of finding the MTD contour into a sequence of one-dimensional dose-finding processes, known as subtrials. The subtrials are conducted sequentially in a certain order, such that the results of each subtrial will be used to inform the design of subsequent subtrials. Such information borrowing allows the waterfall design to explore the two-dimensional dose space efficiently using a limited sample size and decreases the chance of overdosing and underdosing patients. To accommodate the consideration that doses on the MTD contour may have very different efficacy or synergistic effects because of drug-drug interaction, we further extend our approach to a phase I/II design with the goal of finding the MTD with the highest efficacy. Simulation studies show that the waterfall design is safer and has higher probability of identifying the true MTD contour than some existing designs. The R package "BOIN" to implement the waterfall design is freely available from CRAN. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Although the coming wave of older patients with cancer was anticipated in the early 1980s, when the need for more research on the cancer-aging interface was recognized, many knowledge gaps remain when it comes to treating older and/or frailer patients with cancer. Relatively little is known about the best way to balance the risks and benefits of existing cancer therapies in older patients; however, these patients continue to be underrepresented in clinical trials. Furthermore, the available clinical trials often do not include end points pertinent to the older adult population, such as preservation of function, cognition, and independence. As part of its ongoing effort to advance research in the field of geriatric oncology, the Cancer and Aging Research Group held a conference in November 2012 in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute on Aging, and the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology. The goal was to develop recommendations and establish research guidelines for the design and implementation of therapeutic clinical trials for older and/or frail adults. The conference sought to identify knowledge gaps in cancer clinical trials for older adults and propose clinical trial designs to fill these gaps.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed all phase I oncology trials conducted by investigators from the Adult Phase I Unit at Institut Gustave Roussy from 2003 to 2006. We report data concerning patient demographics, treatment outcome, toxicity, survival and type of care after trial exit.
RESULTS: We analyzed 10 trials involving 180 participants. The overall response rate was 7.2\%. Disease control (objective response plus stable disease) was achieved in 48.2\% of patients. The rate of toxic death was 0.5\%. In all, 38\% of patients had at least one episode of grade 3 or 4 toxic events. The median progression-free survival and the median overall survival (OS) were 2.3 and 8.7 months, respectively. On multivariate analysis, a time between diagnosis of disease and inclusion in the phase I trial {\textgreater} or =24 months and evidence of disease control were statistically significant predictors of improved OS.
CONCLUSION: Current phase I oncology trials are safe and are associated with clinical benefit in a substantial proportion of patients.},

	abstract = {The development of potentially powerful drugs which may become effective in the treatment for disorders currently difficult to manage presents the pharmaceutical industry and the scientific community with a major challenge. Such drugs with novel modes of action and the capacity to modify the body's immune system could also be very toxic. The possibility became a tragic reality on March 13th 2006 when TGN1412 was given to six healthy volunteers at Northwick Park hospital. All six became seriously ill. Fortunately none died but some were left with serious residual defects. The British Secretary of State for Health set up an Expert Scientific Group to investigate this tragic event. The report had to make recommendations designed to prevent a recurrence whilst not unduly delaying or discouraging the development of new drugs designed to treat cancers and other serious disorders. They made 22 recommendations. The drug TGN1412 had been shown to be well tolerated by non-human primates. A recent report on non-human primates in research recommended their continued use in some forms of research, for example on brain disorders. However, they also recommended that non-human primates should be used sparingly and only when justified scientifically. Their treatment should be optimal and research on them should be restricted to selected centres of expertise. The tragedy at Northwick Park should encourage the Pharmaceutical Industry to rethink their use of non-human primates in drug toxicity testing and hopefully to reduce their use and treat them better.},

	doi = {10.1093/jnci/85.3.217},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A widely used phase I design in clinical trials of chemotherapy for cancer and for AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) allows for dose escalation in cohorts of three to six patients. Escalation continues until a predefined percentage of patients experience unacceptable toxic effects at a given dose level. A safe and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for phase II study is then determined. This standard phase I study design has serious inadequacies. MTD is not a model-based estimate of the true dose that would yield the targeted dose-limiting toxicity rate. Moreover, this simplistic study design allows some patients in the phase I study to be treated at doses unlikely to have therapeutic efficacy.
PURPOSE: We constructed a novel quantitative assessment design that repetitively evaluates accumulating dose-toxicity data by repeatedly fitting and updating a pharmacodynamic model after small cohorts of patients are treated. The goal was to more accurately estimate the MTD.
METHODS: One hundred phase I studies were simulated by both the standard and quantitative assessment phase I designs. We compared determination of MTD, frequency of grade 0 leukopenia (no toxicity), and study size in the studies simulated using the standard design with those in the studies simulated using the quantitative assessment design.
RESULTS: The median MTD determined from the 100 studies was nearly identical for the two designs: 100 and 95 mg/m2 per day for standard and quantitative assessment designs, respectively. However, the interstudy variation in the MTD was decreased in the quantitative assessment design. Moreover, the study size was significantly reduced (P {\textless} .0001), and the median percentage of patients treated at subtoxic doses (no leukopenia) was significantly lower for the quantitative assessment design (44\% versus 48\%; P {\textless} .0001).
CONCLUSION: Our results show clear evidence that a phase I study design using dose and toxicity data in a repetitive and quantitative manner can identify the MTD with more accuracy than the standard design.
IMPLICATIONS: New approaches must be explored to improve our ability to identify the optimal dose for phase II studies of chemotherapy for cancer and for AIDS. There is evidence that the quantitative assessment design will identify the MTD with fewer patients, more precision, and fewer patients exposed to suboptimal doses.},

	abstract = {The effects of sorafenib--an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting the tumour and tumour vasculature--were evaluated in patients with advanced melanoma enrolled in a large multidisease Phase II randomised discontinuation trial (RDT). Enrolled patients received a 12-week run-in of sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (b.i.d.). Patients with changes in bi-dimensional tumour measurements {\textless}25\% from baseline were then randomised to sorafenib or placebo for a further 12 weeks (ie to week 24). Patients with {\textgreater} or =25\% tumour shrinkage after the run-in continued on open-label sorafenib, whereas those with {\textgreater} or =25\% tumour growth discontinued treatment. This analysis focussed on secondary RDT end points: changes in bi-dimensional tumour measurements from baseline after 12 weeks and overall tumour responses (WHO criteria) at week 24, progression-free survival (PFS), safety and biomarkers (BRAF, KRAS and NRAS mutational status). Of 37 melanoma patients treated during the run-in phase, 34 were evaluable for response: one had {\textgreater} or =25\% tumour shrinkage and remained on open-label sorafenib; six (16\%) had {\textless}25\% tumour growth and were randomised (placebo, n=3; sorafenib, n=3); and 27 had {\textgreater} or =25\% tumour growth and discontinued. All three randomised sorafenib patients progressed by week 24; one remained on sorafenib for symptomatic relief. All three placebo patients progressed by week-24 and were re-started on sorafenib; one experienced disease re-stabilisation. Overall, the confirmed best responses for each of the 37 melanoma patients who received sorafenib were 19\% stable disease (SD) (ie n=1 open-label; n=6 randomised), 62\% (n=23) progressive disease (PD) and 19\% (n=7) unevaluable. The overall median PFS was 11 weeks. The six randomised patients with SD had overall PFS values ranging from 16 to 34 weeks. The most common drug-related adverse events were dermatological (eg rash/desquamation, 51\%; hand-foot skin reaction, 35\%). There was no relationship between V600E BRAF status and disease stability. DNA was extracted from the biopsies of 17/22 patients. Six had V600E-positive tumours (n=4 had PD; n=1 had SD; n=1 unevaluable for response), and 11 had tumours containing wild-type BRAF (n=9 PD; n=1 SD; n=1 unevaluable for response). In conclusion, sorafenib is well tolerated but has little or no antitumour activity in advanced melanoma patients as a single agent at the dose evaluated (400 mg b.i.d.).

We simulated phase II trials by resampling patients from a positive (sorafenib vs. placebo; TARGET) and a negative (AE941 vs. placebo) phase III trial in metastatic renal cancer to compare the ability of various designs and endpoints to predict the known results.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 770 and 259 patients from TARGET and the AE 941 trial, respectively, were resampled (5,000 replicates) to simulate phase II trials with α = 0.10 (one-sided). Designs/endpoints: single arm, two-stage with response rate (RR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; 37 patients); and randomized, two arm (20-35 patients per arm) with RR by RECIST, mean log ratio of tumor sizes (log ratio), progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 90 days (PFS-90), and overall PFS.
RESULTS: Single-arm trials were positive with RR by RECIST in 55\% and 1\% of replications for sorafenib and AE 941, respectively. Randomized trials versus placebo with 20 patients per arm were positive with RR by RECIST in 55\% and 7\%, log ratio in 88\% and 25\%, PFS-90 in 64\% and 15\%, and overall PFS in 69\% and 9\% of replications for sorafenib and AE 941, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the single-arm design and the randomized design comparing PFS, the randomized phase II design with the log ratio endpoint has greater power to predict the positive phase III result of sorafenib in renal cancer, but a higher false positive rate for the negative phase III result of AE 941.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The use of biopsy-derived pharmacodynamic biomarkers is increasing in early-phase clinical trials. It remains unknown whether drug development is accelerated or enhanced by their use. We examined the impact of biopsy-derived pharmacodynamic biomarkers on subsequent drug development through a comprehensive analysis of phase I oncology studies from 2003 to 2010 and subsequent publications citing the original trials.
METHODS: We conducted a search to identify and examine publications of phase I oncology studies including the use of biopsy-derived pharmacodynamic biomarkers between 2003 and 2010. Characteristics of those studies were extracted and analyzed, along with outcomes from the biomarker data. We then compiled and reviewed publications of subsequent phase II and III trials citing the original phase I biomarker studies to determine the impact on drug development.
RESULTS: We identified 4,840 phase I oncology publications between 2003 and 2010. Seventy-two studies included a biopsy-derived pharmacodynamic biomarker. The proportion of biomarker studies including nondiagnostic biopsies increased over time (P = .002). A minimum of 1,873 tumor biopsies were documented in the 72 studies, 12 of which reported a statistically significant biomarker result. Thirty-three percent of studies (n = 24) were referenced by subsequent publications specifically with regard to the biomarkers. Only five positive biomarker studies were cited subsequently, and maximum tolerated dose was used for subsequent drug development in all cases.
CONCLUSION: Despite their increased use, the impact of biopsy-derived pharmacodynamic biomarkers in phase I oncology studies on subsequent drug development remains uncertain. No impact on subsequent dose or schedule was demonstrated. This issue requires further evaluation, given the risk and cost of such studies.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Phase II clinical studies screen for treatment regimens that improve patient care, but screening combination regimens is especially challenging. We hypothesized that recognized flaws of single-arm trials could be magnified in combination treatment studies, leading to many reported positive phase II trials but with a low fraction resulting in practice-changing phase III trials.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We searched medline and identified 363 combination chemotherapy clinical trials published in 2001 and 2002. Studies were rated as positive, negative, or inconclusive based on a standardized review of abstract and text. The Web of Science Index (Thomson Reuters, NY, NY) was searched for all articles published between January 2003 and October 2007 that cited at least one of these 363 published trials.
RESULTS: Of 363 published phase II combination chemotherapy trials, 262 (72\%) were declared to be positive. Among 3,760 unique subsequent citing papers, 20 reported randomized phase III trials of the same combination in the same disease as the source paper, and 10 of these resulted in improved standards of care. Estimating from these data, the likelihood that a published, positive phase II combination chemotherapy trial will result in a subsequent trial showing an improvement in standard of care within five years was 0.038 (95\% confidence interval, 0.016-0.064).
CONCLUSIONS: The contributory value of combination chemotherapy phase II trials done by 2001-2002 standards is low despite the participation of more than 16,000 subjects. Future phase II studies of combination regimens require better methods to screen for treatments most likely to improve standards of care.},

	abstract = {Background: Many cancer patients who receive chemotherapy experience adverse drug effects. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) has promise to personalize chemotherapy drug dosing to maximize efficacy and safety. Fluoropyrimidines and irinotecan have well-known germline PGx associations. At our institution, we have delivered PGx clinical decision support (CDS) based on preemptively obtained genotyping results for a large number of non-oncology medications since 2012, but have not previously evaluated the utility of this strategy for patients initiating anti-cancer regimens. We hypothesize that providing oncologists with preemptive germline PGx information along with CDS will enable individualized dosing decisions and result in improved patient outcomes.
Methods: Patients with oncologic malignancies for whom fluoropyrimidine and/or irinotecan-inclusive therapy is being planned will be enrolled and randomly assigned to PGx and control arms. Patients will be genotyped in a clinical laboratory across panels that include actionable variants in UGT1A1 and DPYD. For PGx arm patients, treating providers will be given access to the patient-specific PGx results with CDS prior to treatment initiation. In the control arm, genotyping will be deferred, and dosing will occur as per usual care. Co-primary endpoints are dose intensity deviation rate (the proportion of patients receiving dose modifications during the first treatment cycle), and grade ⩾3 treatment-related toxicities throughout the treatment course. Additional study endpoints will include cumulative drug dose intensity, progression-free survival, dosing of additional PGx supportive medications, and patient-reported quality of life and understanding of PGx.
Discussion: Providing a platform of integrated germline PGx information may promote personalized chemotherapy dosing decisions and establish a new model of care to optimize oncology treatment planning.},

Sensory peripheral neuropathy (PN) is the major dose-limiting toxicity for MTAs and can limit clinical efficacy. The current pharmacogenomic study aimed to identify genetic variations that explain patient susceptibility and drive mechanisms underlying development of MTA-induced PN. A meta-analysis of genomewide association studies (GWAS) from two clinical cohorts treated with MTAs (Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 40502 and CALGB 40101) was conducted using a Cox regression model with cumulative dose to first instance of grade 2 or higher PN. Summary statistics from a GWAS of European subjects (n = 469) in CALGB 40502 that estimated cause-specific risk of PN were meta-analyzed with those from a previously published GWAS of European ancestry (n = 855) from CALGB 40101 that estimated the risk of PN. Novel single nucleotide polymorphisms in an enhancer region downstream of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1 encoding S1PR1 ; e.g., rs74497159, βCALGB 40101 per allele log hazard ratio (95\% confidence interval (CI)) = 0.591 (0.254-0.928), βCALGB 40502 per allele log hazard ratio (95\% CI) = 0.693 (0.334-1.053); PMETA  = 3.62 × 10-7 ) were the most highly ranked associations based on P values with risk of developing grade 2 and higher PN. In silico functional analysis identified multiple regulatory elements and potential enhancer activity for S1PR1 within this genomic region. Inhibition of S1PR1 function in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human sensory neurons shows partial protection against paclitaxel-induced neurite damage. These pharmacogenetic findings further support ongoing clinical evaluations to target S1PR1 as a therapeutic strategy for prevention and/or treatment of MTA-induced neuropathy.},

	abstract = {The Chemotherapy Committee of Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) was established in the mid-1970s to assemble a group of experts in cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology who could advise the CALGB disease committees about the optimal use of drugs in the fight against cancer and to provide quality assurance for the chemotherapy section of CALGB protocols. Chaired initially by Edward Henderson and then David Van Echo, the committee was also the repository of studies in diseases for which CALGB did not have a formal committee, such as testis cancer and sarcoma. In 1990, following the appointment of Richard Schilsky as Chair, the name of the committee was changed to the Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (PET) Committee to reflect a more specific focus and scientific agenda (i.e., studies of chemotherapy pharmacology and development of new agents). Three PET Committee reference pharmacology laboratories (led by Merrill Egorin, Tony Miller, and Mark Ratain) were established to measure drug concentrations in biological fluids and to perform pharmacokinetic analyses. In addition, the PET Committee embarked on a number of multi-institution phase I studies. These phase I studies included studies of special populations, including the first prospective study of an anticancer agent (paclitaxel) in patients with hepatic dysfunction. In addition, the Committee studied a number of phase I combinations destined for phase II evaluation in disease-specific committees. Following Dr. Schilsky's election as CALGB Group Chair in 1994, Mark Ratain took over as Chair of the PET Committee and continued to emphasize population pharmacology as the primary theme of the Committee's research agenda. In addition, the PET Committee began to develop novel clinical trial designs, including the first completed randomized discontinuation trial of an antineoplastic agent. Most recently, the PET Committee has launched an ambitious research program in pharmacogenetics, facilitated in large part through the recruitment of Howard McLeod as Vice Chair. This area of research is a collaborative effort with the NIH Pharmacogenetics Research Network and has the potential to definitively address the hypothesis that germ line polymorphisms are a significant determinant of the toxicity and efficacy of anticancer therapy. It is anticipated that the results of the current studies will contribute significantly to the goal of individualizing cancer treatment.},

Despite a large food effect, AA was administered under fasting conditions in its pivotal trials. We sought to test the hypothesis that low-dose AA (LOW; 250 mg with a low-fat meal) would have comparable activity to standard AA (STD; 1,000 mg fasting) in patients with CRPC. Patients and Methods Patients (n = 72) with progressive CRPC from seven institutions in the United States and Singapore were randomly assigned to STD or LOW. Both arms received prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was assessed monthly, and testosterone/dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were assessed every 12 weeks with disease burden radiographic assessments. Plasma was collected for drug concentrations. Log change in PSA, as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for efficacy, was the primary end point, using a noninferiority design. Progression-free survival (PFS), PSA response (≥ 50\% reduction), change in androgen levels, and pharmacokinetics were secondary end points. Results Thirty-six patients were accrued to both arms. At 12 weeks, there was a greater effect on PSA in the LOW arm (mean log change, -1.59) compared with STD (-1.19), and noninferiority of LOW was established according to predefined criteria. The PSA response rate was 58\% in LOW and 50\% in STD, and the median PFS was approximately 9 months in both groups. Androgen levels decreased similarly in both arms. Although there was no difference in PSA response or PFS, abiraterone concentrations were higher in STD. Conclusion Low-dose AA (with low-fat breakfast) is noninferior to standard dosing with respect to PSA metrics. Given the pharmacoeconomic implications, these data warrant consideration by prescribers, payers, and patients. Additional studies are indicated to assess the long-term efficacy of this approach.},

Currently, single-arm phase II trial results are interpreted relative to historical control subjects, introducing selection bias and confounding that may limit the validity of the conclusions. The rate of success (defined as a statistically significant difference between arms) in phase III oncology trials is only 40\%, suggesting that current phase II trials are insufficiently informative. However, simulation studies suggest that randomized phase II trials would have lower error rates and greater predictive power for phase III results. Randomized phase II trials may also be more informative than single-arm phase II trials because of the hypotheses being tested, the variety of possible endpoints, and the opportunities for biomarker discovery. There are a wide variety of randomized phase II designs that can be used, including the randomized discontinuation design, the delayed-start design, adaptive (Bayesian) designs, selection designs, and phase II/III designs. The barriers to widespread adoption of randomized phase II trials include time to completion, sample size considerations, and ethical concerns, but none are insurmountable. We conclude that randomized phase II trials are a worthy investment considering finite patient and financial resources and should be the rule rather than the exception for evaluating novel therapies in oncology.},

We aimed to (1) identify an early time point that is predictive of future neuropathy using a patient-reported outcome and (2) propose a dose-adjustment algorithm based on simulated data to manage neuropathy. In previous work, a dose-neuropathy model was developed using dosing and patient-reported outcome data from Cancer and Leukemia Group B 40502 (Alliance), a randomized phase III trial of paclitaxel, nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel or ixabepilone as first-line chemotherapy for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. In the current work, an early time point that is predictive of the future severity of neuropathy was identified based on predictive accuracy of the model. Using the early data and model parameters, simulations were conducted to propose a dose-adjustment algorithm for the prospective management of neuropathy in individual patients. The end of the first 3 cycles (12 weeks) was identified as the early time point based on a predictive accuracy of 75\% for the neuropathy score after 6 cycles. For paclitaxel, nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel, and ixabepilone, simulations with the proposed dose-adjustment algorithm resulted in 61\%, 48\%, and 35\% fewer patients, respectively, with neuropathy score ≥8 after 6 cycles compared to no dose adjustment. We conclude that early patient-reported outcome data on neuropathy can be used to guide dose adjustments in individual patients that reduce the severity of future neuropathy.

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              The overwhelming majority of dose-escalation clinical trials use methods that seek a maximum tolerable dose, including rule-based methods like the 3+3, and model-based methods like CRM and EWOC. These methods assume that the incidences of efficacy and toxicity always increase as dose is increased. This assumption is widely accepted with cytotoxic therapies. In recent decades, however, the search for novel cancer treatments has broadened, increasingly focusing on inhibitors and antibodies. The rationale that higher doses are always associated with superior efficacy is less clear for these types of therapies.
            
            
              Methods
              We extracted dose-level efficacy and toxicity outcomes from 115 manuscripts reporting dose-finding clinical trials in cancer between 2008 and 2014. We analysed the outcomes from each manuscript using flexible non-linear regression models to investigate the evidence supporting the monotonic efficacy and toxicity assumptions.
            
            
              Results
              We found that the monotonic toxicity assumption was well-supported across most treatment classes and disease areas. In contrast, we found very little evidence supporting the monotonic efficacy assumption.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our conclusion is that dose-escalation trials routinely use methods whose assumptions are violated by the outcomes observed. As a consequence, dose-finding trials risk recommending unjustifiably high doses that may be harmful to patients. We recommend that trialists consider experimental designs that allow toxicity and efficacy outcomes to jointly determine the doses given to patients and recommended for further study.},

	issn = {2045-7634},
	doi = {10.1002/cam4.4239},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are common, clinically significant autoinflammatory toxicities observed with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Preexisting immune-mediated inflammatory disease (pre-IMID) is considered a relative contraindication to ICI due to the risk of inciting flares. Improved understanding of the risks and benefits of treating pre-IMID patients with ICI is needed.
METHODS: We studied melanoma patients treated with ICI and enrolled in a prospective clinicopathological database. We compiled a list of 23 immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and evaluated their presence prior to ICI. We tested the associations between pre-IMID and progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and irAEs.
RESULTS: In total, 483 melanoma patients were included in the study; 74 had pre-IMID and 409 did not. In patients receiving ICI as a standard of care (SoC), pre-IMID was significantly associated with irAEs (p = 0.04) as well as improved PFS (p = 0.024) and OS (p = 0.007). There was no significant association between pre-IMID and irAEs (p = 0.54), PFS (p = 0.197), or OS (p = 0.746) in patients treated through a clinical trial. Pre-IMID was significantly associated with improved OS in females (p = 0.012), but not in males (p = 0.35).
CONCLUSIONS: The dichotomy of the impact of pre-IMID on survival and irAEs in SoC versus clinical trial patients may reflect the inherit selection bias in patients accrued in clinical trials. Future mechanistic work is required to better understand the differences in outcomes between female and male pre-IMID patients. Our data challenge the notion that clinicians should avoid ICI in pre-IMID patients, although close monitoring and prospective clinical trials evaluating ICI in this population are warranted.},

	abstract = {Phase 1 dose-escalation trials are crucial to drug development by providing a framework to assess the toxicity of novel agents in a stepwise and monitored fashion. Despite widely adopted, rule-based dose-escalation methods (such as 3 + 3) are limited in finding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and tend to treat a significant number of patients at subtherapeutic doses. Newer methods of dose escalation, such as model-based and model-assisted designs, have emerged and are more accurate in finding MTD. However, these designs have not yet been broadly embraced by investigators. In this review, we summarise the advantages and disadvantages of contemporary dose-escalation methods, with emphasis on model-assisted designs, including time-to-event designs and hybrid methods involving optimal biological dose (OBD). The methods reviewed include mTPI, keyboard, BOIN, and their variations. In addition, the challenges of drug development (and dose-escalation) in the era of immunotherapeutics are discussed, where many of these agents typically have a wide therapeutic window. Fictional examples of how the dose-escalation method chosen can alter the outcomes of a phase 1 study are described, including the number of patients enrolled, the trial’s timeframe, and the dose level chosen as MTD. Finally, the recent trends in dose-escalation methods applied in phase 1 trials in the immunotherapeutics era are reviewed. Among 856 phase I trials from 2014 to 2019, a trend towards the increased use of model-based and model-assisted designs over time (OR = 1.24) was detected. However, only 8\% of the studies used non-rule-based dose-escalation methods. Increasing familiarity with such dose-escalation methods will likely facilitate their uptake in clinical trials.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Prognosis for adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is poor, and there are currently no licensed CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapeutics. We developed a novel second-generation CD19-CAR (CAT19-41BB-Z) with a fast off rate, designed for more physiologic T-cell activation to reduce toxicity and improve engraftment. We describe the multicenter phase I ALLCAR19 (NCT02935257) study of autologous CAT19-41BB-Z CAR T cells (AUTO1) in relapsed or refractory (r/r) adult B-ALL.
METHODS: Patients age ≥ 16 years with r/r B-ALL were eligible. Primary outcomes were toxicity and manufacturing feasibility. Secondary outcomes were depth of response at 1 and 3 months, persistence of CAR-T, incidence and duration of hypogammaglobulinemia and B-cell aplasia, and event-free survival and overall survival at 1 and 2 years.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were leukapheresed, 24 products were manufactured, and 20 patients were infused with AUTO1. The median age was 41.5 years; 25\% had prior blinatumomab, 50\% prior inotuzumab ozogamicin, and 65\% prior allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. At the time of preconditioning, 45\% had ≥ 50\% bone marrow blasts. No patients experienced ≥ grade 3 cytokine release syndrome; 3 of 20 (15\%) experienced grade 3 neurotoxicity that resolved to ≤ grade 1 within 72 hours with steroids. Seventeen of 20 (85\%) achieved minimal residual disease-negative complete response at month 1, and 3 of 17 underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation while in remission. The event-free survival at 6 and 12 months was 68.3\% (42.4-84.4) and 48.3\% (23.1\%-69.7\%), respectively. High-level expansion (Cmax 127,152 copies/µg genomic DNA) and durable CAR-T persistence were observed with B-cell aplasia ongoing in 15 of 20 patients at last follow-up.
CONCLUSION: AUTO1 demonstrates a tolerable safety profile, high remission rates, and excellent persistence in r/r adult B-ALL. Preliminary data support further development of AUTO1 as a stand-alone treatment for r/r adult B-ALL.},

	abstract = {Background
              
                MVA-BN-brachyury-TRICOM is a recombinant vector-based therapeutic cancer vaccine designed to induce an immune response against brachyury. Brachyury, a transcription factor overexpressed in advanced cancers, has been associated with treatment resistance, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and metastatic potential. MVA-BN-brachyury-TRICOM has demonstrated immunogenicity and safety in previous clinical trials of subcutaneously administered vaccine. Preclinical studies have suggested that intravenous administration of therapeutic vaccines can induce superior CD8
                +
                T cell responses, higher levels of systemic cytokine release, and stronger natural killer cell activation and proliferation. This is the first-in-human study of the intravenous administration of MVA-BN-brachyury-TRICOM.
              
            
            
              Methods
              Between January 2020 and March 2021, 13 patients were treated on a phase 1, open-label, 3+3 design, dose-escalation study at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. The study population was adults with advanced solid tumors and was enriched for chordoma, a rare sarcoma of the notochord that overexpresses brachyury. Vaccine was administered intravenously at three DLs on days 1, 22, and 43. Blood samples were taken to assess drug pharmacokinetics and immune activation. Imaging was conducted at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months post-treatment. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability as determined by the frequency of dose-limiting toxicities; a secondary endpoint was determination of the recommended phase 2 dose.
            
            
              Results
              No dose-limiting toxicities were observed and no serious adverse events were attributed to the vaccine. Vaccine-related toxicities were consistent with class profile (ie, influenza-like symptoms). Cytokine release syndrome up to grade 2 was observed with no adverse outcomes. Dose-effect trend was observed for fever, chills/rigor, and hypotension. Efficacy analysis of objective response rate per RECIST 1.1 at the end of study showed one patient with a partial response, four with stable disease, and eight with progressive disease. Three patients with stable disease experienced clinical benefit in the form of improvement in pain. Immune correlatives showed T cell activation against brachyury and other tumor-associated cascade antigens.
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                Intravenous administration of MVA-BN-brachyury-TRICOM vaccine was safe and tolerable. Maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The maximum administered dose was 10
                9
                infectious units every 3 weeks for three doses. This dose was selected as the recommended phase 2 dose.

METHODS: We used R Shiny to develop a web-based software platform to facilitate the use of recent novel adaptive designs.
RESULTS: We developed a web-based software suite, called Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) suite, which includes R Shiny applications to handle various clinical settings, including single-agent phase I trials with and without prior information, trials with late-onset toxicity, trials to find the optimal biological dose based on risk-benefit trade-off, and drug combination trials to find a single maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the MTD contour. The applications are built using the same software architecture to ensure the best and a uniform user experience, and they are developed using a proven software development standard operating procedure to ensure accuracy, robustness, and reproducibility. The suite is freely available with internet access and a web browser without the need of installing any other software.
CONCLUSION: The BOIN suite allows clinical researchers to design various types of early-phase clinical trials under a unified framework. This work is extremely important because it not only advances the clinical research and drug development by facilitating the use of novel trial designs with optimal performance but also enhances collaborations between biostatisticians and clinicians by disseminating novel statistical methodology to broader scientific communities through user-friendly software. The BOIN suite establishes a KISS principle: keep it simple, but smart.},

Initial experimentation and sequential updating are carried out in a natural way within the context of a Bayesian framework. In this paper we argue that such a framework is easily changed to a more classic one leaning upon likelihood theory. The essential features of the continual reassessment method remain unchanged. In particular, large sample properties are the same unless the prior is degenerate. For small samples and as far as the final recommended dose level is concerned, simulations indicate that there is not much to choose between a likelihood approach and a Bayesian one. However, for in-trial allocation of dose levels to patients, there are some differences and these are discussed. In contrast to the Bayesian approach, a likelihood one requires some extra effort to get off the ground. This is because the likelihood equation has no solution until we observe a toxicity. Initially then we suggest working with either a standard Up-and-Down scheme or standard continual reassessment method until toxicity is observed and then switching to the new scheme.},

When patient outcome cannot be observed immediately after treatment, the problem arises of how to deal with new patients while waiting to observe the current patient cohort's outcomes. We consider two alternative approaches to this problem in the context of a phase I trial conducted using the continual reassessment method. With the first approach, a patient requiring treatment before the next cohort opens is treated off protocol with standard therapy, and otherwise waits until the next cohort opens. The second approach treats each patient immediately upon arrival at the dose recommended based on currently available data. We compare these two approaches by simulation under varying dose--toxicity curves, accrual rates, cohort sizes and early stopping rules. We evaluate patient waiting time, trial duration, number of patients treated off protocol and the probabilities of toxicity and of selecting the correct dose. We also study three strategies for assigning patients to trials when two or more phase I trials may be ongoing simultaneously. Based on our results, we provide practical guidelines for deciding among these approaches and strategies in a given clinical setting.},

Experts agree that frailty is a medical syndrome marked by reduced physiologic function, which increases the risk of vulnerability and short-term mortality, particularly in the face of a stressor. Frailty has been shown to predict poor outcomes including falls, disability, major morbidity following surgery, and mortality among older adults. Despite hundreds of papers identifying frailty as a useful marker of risk, its translation into clinical practice has lagged. The Successful Aging and Frailty Evaluation (SAFE) clinic was established in 2011 specifically to implement routine and structured frailty assessment and management in a variety of referred patients.

	abstract = {PURPOSE
              Phase I trials are a crucial step in the evaluation of new cancer therapies. Historically, low rates of response (5\%) and comparably high rates of death from toxicities (0.5\%) have contributed to debates on the ethics and orientation of these trials. With the introduction of novel targeted therapies, a contemporary estimate is needed.
            
            
              METHODS
              We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov for reports of phase I oncology trials of single-agent targeted immunomodulators, molecularly targeted therapies, and antiangiogenic agents, published between January 2015 and July 2018. Adult and pediatric trials of solid and hematological malignancies were eligible. Treatment-related adverse events (grades 3, 4, and 5) and response rates (objective, complete, and partial) were extracted and analyzed.
            
            
              RESULTS
              One hundred and fifty-eight trial reports, covering 6,707 patients, were included. The rate of treatment-related deaths was 0.0\% (95\% CI, 0.0 to 0.1), while 13.2\% of patients (9.5 to 17.3) experienced a grade 3 or 4 treatment-related toxicity. The combined objective response rate was 6.4\% (4.6 to 8.5). Among trials using tumor biomarkers as eligibility criteria, the objective response rate was higher (12.0\% [7.3 to 17.6] compared to 4.9\% [2.5 to 5.7], P value {\textless} .01). The same was true of trials focusing on a single tumor type (13.4\% [8.2 to 19.4]) compared to multiple tumor types (3.8\% [2.5 to 5.3], P value {\textless} .01).
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Reduced grade 5 risk and improved benefit appears to exist in modern phase I oncology trials, particularly in trials that target single tumor types and integrate biomarkers as eligibility criteria. These findings provide information to support informed consent discussions, highlight the need for improved reporting of phase I oncology trials, and provide direction for optimizing their design.},

	abstract = {Immune effector cell (IEC) therapies offer durable and sustained remissions in significant numbers of patients with hematological cancers. While these unique immunotherapies have improved outcomes for pediatric and adult patients in a number of disease states, as ‘living drugs,’ their toxicity profiles, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), differ markedly from conventional cancer therapeutics. At the time of article preparation, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved tisagenlecleucel, axicabtagene ciloleucel, and brexucabtagene autoleucel, all of which are IEC therapies based on genetically modified T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and additional products are expected to reach marketing authorization soon and to enter clinical development in due course. As IEC therapies, especially CAR T cell therapies, enter more widespread clinical use, there is a need for clear, cohesive recommendations on toxicity management, motivating the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) to convene an expert panel to develop a clinical practice guideline. The panel discussed the recognition and management of common toxicities in the context of IEC treatment, including baseline laboratory parameters for monitoring, timing to onset, and pharmacological interventions, ultimately forming evidence- and consensus-based recommendations to assist medical professionals in decision-making and to improve outcomes for patients.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Older adults are at increased risk for chemotherapy toxicity, and standard oncology assessment measures cannot identify those at risk. A predictive model for chemotherapy toxicity was developed (N = 500) that consisted of geriatric assessment questions and other clinical variables. This study aims to externally validate this model in an independent cohort (N = 250).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients age ≥ 65 years with a solid tumor, fluent in English, and who were scheduled to receive a new chemotherapy regimen were recruited from eight institutions. Risk of chemotherapy toxicity was calculated (low, medium, or high risk) on the basis of the prediction model before the start of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-related toxicity was captured (grade 3 [hospitalization indicated], grade 4 [life threatening], and grade 5 [treatment-related death]). Validation of the prediction model was performed by calculating the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve.
RESULTS: The study sample (N = 250) had a mean age of 73 years (range, 65 to 94 [standard deviation, 5.8]). More than one half of patients (58\%) experienced grade ≥ 3 toxicity. Risk of toxicity increased with increasing risk score (36.7\% low, 62.4\% medium, 70.2\% high risk; P {\textless} .001). The area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.65 (95\% CI, 0.58 to 0.71), which was not statistically different from the development cohort (0.72; 95\% CI, 0.68 to 0.77; P = .09). There was no association between Karnofsky Performance Status and chemotherapy toxicity (P = .25).
CONCLUSION: This study externally validated a chemotherapy toxicity predictive model for older adults with cancer. This predictive model should be considered when discussing the risks and benefits of chemotherapy with older adults.},

This task becomes significantly more challenging when multiple-drug dose-combinations (DC) are involved, due to the inherent conflict between the exponentially increasing DC candidates and the limited patient budget. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian design, SDF-Bayes, for finding the MTD for drug combinations in the presence of safety constraints. Rather than the conventional principle of escalating or de-escalating the current dose of one drug (perhaps alternating between drugs), SDF-Bayes proceeds by cautious optimism: it chooses the next DC that, on the basis of current information, is most likely to be the MTD (optimism), subject to the constraint that it only chooses DCs that have a high probability of being safe (caution). We also propose an extension, SDF-Bayes-AR, that accounts for patient heterogeneity and enables heterogeneous patient recruitment. Extensive experiments based on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of SDF-Bayes over state of the art DC trial designs in terms of accuracy and safety.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the landscape in clinical trial development has changed to involve many molecularly targeted agents, immunotherapies, or radiotherapy, as a single agent or in combination. Given their different mechanisms of action and lengths of administration, these agents have different toxicity profiles, which has resulted in numerous challenges when applying traditional designs such as the 3 + 3 design in dose-finding clinical trials. Novel methods have been proposed to address these design challenges such as combinations of therapies or late-onset toxicities. However, their design and implementation require close collaboration between clinicians and statisticians to ensure that the appropriate design is selected to address the aims of the study and that the design assumptions are pertinent to the study drug. The goal of this paper is to provide guidelines for appropriate questions that should be considered early in the design stage to facilitate the interactions between clinical and statistical teams and to improve the design of dose-finding clinical trials for novel anticancer agents.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe long-term outcomes of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cells in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
METHODS: Between January 2013 and June 2016, 42 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL were enrolled in this study and 38 were infused with anti-CD19 CART cells (CART-19). Of these, 28 patients were initially randomly assigned to receive a low (5 × 107) or high (5 × 108) dose of CART-19, and 24 were evaluable for response assessment. After an interim analysis, 10 additional patients received the selected (high) dose and of these, eight were evaluable for response. Patients were followed for a median 31.5 months (range, 2 to 75 months).
RESULTS: At 4 weeks, the complete and overall responses for the 32 evaluable patients were 28\% (90\% CI, 16\% to 44\%) and 44\% (90\% CI, 29\% to 60\%), respectively. The median overall survival (OS) for all patients was 64 months; there was no statistically significant difference between low- and high-dose groups (P = .84). Regardless of dose, prolonged survival was observed in patients who achieved a CR versus those who did not (P = .035), with median OS not reached in patients with CR versus 64 months in those without CR. The median progression-free survival was 40.2 months in patients with CR and 1 month in those without a CR (P {\textless} .0001). Toxicity was comparable in both dose groups.
CONCLUSION: In patients with advanced CLL, a 5 × 108 dose of CART-19 may be more effective than 5 × 107 CART-19 at inducing CR without excessive toxicity. Attainment of a CR after CART-19 infusion, regardless of cell dose, is associated with longer OS and progression-free survival in patients with relapsed CLL.},

Here we report a 20-year follow-up of this investigation.
METHODS: In 1973 we began a trial involving 386 women who were randomly assigned to receive either no further treatment after radical mastectomy (179 women) or 12 monthly cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy (207 women). All patients were admitted to the Istituto Nazionale Tumori in Milan, Italy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was delivered in the outpatient clinic of the Division of Medical Oncology.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 19.4 years, the patients given adjuvant combination chemotherapy had significantly better rates of relapse-free survival (unadjusted relative risk of relapse, 0.71; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.90; P = 0.004; adjusted relative risk, 0.65, 95 percent confidence interval, 0.51 to 0.83; P {\textless} 0.001) and total survival (unadjusted relative risk of death, 0.78; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.99; P = 0.04; adjusted relative risk, 0.76; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.97; P = 0.03). With the exception of postmenopausal women, a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy was evident in all subgroups of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The long-term results of this trial of adjuvant combination chemotherapy confirm our preliminary observations of the effectiveness of the treatment in women with node-positive breast cancer.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE
              The 21-gene recurrence score (RS) is prognostic for distant recurrence (DR) and predictive for chemotherapy benefit in early breast cancer, whereas clinical-pathological factors are only prognostic. Integration of genomic and clinical features offers the potential to guide adjuvant chemotherapy use with greater precision.
            
            
              METHODS
              We developed a new tool (RSClin) that integrates RS with tumor grade, tumor size, and age using a patient-specific meta-analysis including 10,004 women with hormone receptor–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative, and node-negative breast cancer who received endocrine therapy alone in the B-14 (n = 577) and TAILORx (n = 4,854) trials or plus chemotherapy in TAILORx (n = 4,573). Cox models for RSClin were compared with RS alone and clinical-pathological features alone using likelihood ratio tests. RSClin estimates of DR used a baseline risk with TAILORx event rates to reflect current medical practice. A patient-specific estimator of absolute chemotherapy benefit was computed using individualized relative chemotherapy effect from the randomized TAILORx and B-20 trials. External validation of risk estimation was performed by comparing RSClin estimated risk and observed risk in 1,098 women in the Clalit registry.
            
            
              RESULTS
              
                RSClin provides more prognostic information (likelihood ratio χ
                2
                ) for DR than RS or clinical-pathological factors alone (both P {\textless} .001, likelihood ratio test). In external validation, the RSClin risk estimate was prognostic for DR risk in the Clalit registry ( P {\textless} .001) and the estimated risk closely approximated the observed 10-year risk (Lin concordance 0.962). The absolute chemotherapy benefit estimate ranges from 0\% to 15\% as the RS ranges from 11 to 50 using RSClin in a 55-year-old woman with a 1.5-cm intermediate-grade tumor.
              
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              The RSClin tool integrates clinical-pathological and genomic risk to guide adjuvant chemotherapy in node-negative breast cancer and provides more individualized information than clinical-pathological or genomic data alone.},

              The aim of this work is to update key recommendations of the ASCO guideline adaptation of the Cancer Care Ontario guideline on the selection of optimal adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for early breast cancer and adjuvant targeted therapy for breast cancer.
            
            
              METHODS
              An Expert Panel conducted a targeted systematic literature review guided by a signals approach to identify new, potentially practice-changing data that might translate into revised guideline recommendations.
            
            
              RESULTS
              The Expert Panel reviewed abstracts from the literature review and identified one article for inclusion that reported results of the phase III, open-label KATHERINE trial. In the KATHERINE trial, patients with stage I to III human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–positive breast cancer with residual invasive disease in the breast or axilla after completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy were allocated to adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1; n = 743) or to trastuzumab (n = 743). Invasive disease–free survival was significantly higher in the T-DM1 group than in the trastuzumab arm (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95\% CI, 0.39 to 0.64; P {\textless} .001), and risk of distant recurrence was lower in patients who received T-DM1 than in patients who received trastuzumab (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.45 to 0.79). Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 190 patients (25.7\%) who received T-DM1 and in 111 patients (15.4\%) who received trastuzumab.
            
            
              RECOMMENDATIONS
              Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with pathologic invasive residual disease at surgery after standard preoperative chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy should be offered 14 cycles of adjuvant T-DM1, unless there is disease recurrence or unmanageable toxicity. Clinicians may offer any of the available and approved formulations of trastuzumab, including trastuzumab, trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk, and available biosimilars.

Here, we describe the design and development of AZD0466, a drug-dendrimer conjugate, where AZD4320 is chemically conjugated to a PEGylated poly-lysine dendrimer. Mathematical modelling was employed to determine the optimal release rate of the drug from the dendrimer for maximal therapeutic index in terms of preclinical anti-tumour efficacy and cardiovascular tolerability. The optimised candidate is shown to be efficacious and better tolerated in preclinical models compared with AZD4320 alone. The AZD4320-dendrimer conjugate (AZD0466) identified, through mathematical modelling, has resulted in an improved therapeutic index and thus enabled progression of this promising dual Bcl-2/Bcl-x

HTBC patients received a single dose of tocilizumab (8-12 mg/kg) after development of high, persistent fevers. LTBC patients received standard CRS management. The primary end point was the frequency of grade 4 CRS (Penn scale), with an observed rate of ≤ 5 of 15 patients in the HTBC pre-defined as clinically meaningful. In post hoc analyses, the HTBC was compared with a historical cohort of high-tumor burden patients from the initial phase I CTL019 trial.
RESULTS: The primary end point was met. Seventy patients were infused with CTL019, 15 in the HTBC and 55 in the LTBC. All HTBC patients received the PT intervention. The incidence of grade 4 CRS was 27\% (95\% CI, 8 to 55) in the HTBC and 3.6\% (95\% CI, 0.4 to 13) in the LTBC. The best overall response rate was 87\% in the HTBC and 100\% in the LTBC. Initial CTL019 expansion was greater in the HTBC than the LTBC (P {\textless} .001), but persistence was not different (P = .73). Event-free and overall survival were worse in the HTBC (P = .004, P {\textless} .001, respectively). In the post hoc analysis, grade 4 CRS was observed in 27\% versus 50\% of patients in the PT and prior phase I cohorts, respectively (P = .18).
CONCLUSION: Risk-adapted PT administration resulted in a decrease in the expected incidence of grade 4 CRS, meeting the study end point, without adversely impacting the antitumor efficacy or safety of CTL019.},

We consider statistical designs for dose-finding adoptive cell therapy trials, in which the monotonic dose–response relationship assumed in traditional oncology trials may not hold. Building upon a previous design called “TEPI”, we propose a new dose finding method – Probability Intervals of Toxicity and Efficacy (PRINTE), which utilizes toxicity and efficacy jointly in making dosing decisions, does not require a pre-elicited decision table and at the same time can handle Ockham’s razor properly in the statistical inference. We show that optimizing the joint posterior expected utility of toxicity and efficacy under a 0–1 loss is equivalent to maximizing the marginal model posterior probability in the two-dimensional probability space. An extensive simulation study under various scenarios are conducted and results show that PRINTE outperforms existing designs in the literature since it assigns more patients to optimal doses and less to toxic ones, and selects optimal doses with higher percentages. The simple and transparent features together with good operating characteristics make PRINTE an improved design for dose-finding trials in oncology trials.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Limited tools exist to predict the risk of chemotherapy toxicity in older adults with early-stage breast cancer.
METHODS: Patients of age ≥ 65 years with stage I-III breast cancer from 16 institutions treated with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy were prospectively evaluated for geriatric and clinical features predictive of grade 3-5 chemotherapy toxicity. Logistic regression with best-subsets selection was used to identify and incorporate independent predictors of toxicity into a model with weighted variable scoring. Model performance was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC) and goodness-of-fit statistics. The model was internally and externally validated.
RESULTS: In 473 patients (283 in development and 190 in validation cohort), 46\% developed grade 3-5 chemotherapy toxicities. Eight independent predictors were identified (each assigned weighted points): anthracycline use (1 point), stage II or III (3 points), planned treatment duration {\textgreater} 3 months (4 points), abnormal liver function (3 points), low hemoglobin (3 points), falls (4 points), limited walking (3 points), and lack of social support (3 points). We calculated risk scores for each patient and defined three risk groups: low (0-5 points), intermediate (6-11 points), or high (≥ 12 points). In the development cohort, the rates of grade 3-5 chemotherapy toxicity for these three groups were 19\%, 54\%, and 87\%, respectively (P {\textless} .01). In the validation cohort, the corresponding toxicity rates were 27\%, 45\%, and 76\%. The AUC was 0.75 (95\% CI, 0.70 to 0.81) in the development cohort and 0.69 (95\% CI, 0.62 to 0.77) in the validation cohort. Risk groups were also associated with hospitalizations and reduced dose intensity (P {\textless} .01).
CONCLUSION: The Cancer and Aging Research Group-Breast Cancer (CARG-BC) score was developed and validated to predict grade 3-5 chemotherapy toxicity in older adults with early-stage breast cancer.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Older adults are at increased risk for chemotherapy toxicity, and standard oncology assessment measures cannot identify those at risk. A predictive model for chemotherapy toxicity was developed (N = 500) that consisted of geriatric assessment questions and other clinical variables. This study aims to externally validate this model in an independent cohort (N = 250).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients age ≥ 65 years with a solid tumor, fluent in English, and who were scheduled to receive a new chemotherapy regimen were recruited from eight institutions. Risk of chemotherapy toxicity was calculated (low, medium, or high risk) on the basis of the prediction model before the start of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-related toxicity was captured (grade 3 [hospitalization indicated], grade 4 [life threatening], and grade 5 [treatment-related death]). Validation of the prediction model was performed by calculating the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve.
RESULTS: The study sample (N = 250) had a mean age of 73 years (range, 65 to 94 [standard deviation, 5.8]). More than one half of patients (58\%) experienced grade ≥ 3 toxicity. Risk of toxicity increased with increasing risk score (36.7\% low, 62.4\% medium, 70.2\% high risk; P {\textless} .001). The area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.65 (95\% CI, 0.58 to 0.71), which was not statistically different from the development cohort (0.72; 95\% CI, 0.68 to 0.77; P = .09). There was no association between Karnofsky Performance Status and chemotherapy toxicity (P = .25).
CONCLUSION: This study externally validated a chemotherapy toxicity predictive model for older adults with cancer. This predictive model should be considered when discussing the risks and benefits of chemotherapy with older adults.},

Indeed, it is evident that advanced tumors have heterogeneous molecular landscapes that mostly differ between patients. Traditional modes of clinical research/practice are drug centered, with a strategy of finding commonalities between patients so that they can be grouped together and treated similarly.

METHODS: Extensive collaboration between statisticians and clinical investigators revealed the need to incorporate several adaptive features into the design, including the flexibility of adding or eliminating certain dose combinations based on safety criteria applied to multiple dose pairs. During the design stage, additional dose levels of vinblastine were added, increasing the dimension of the drug combination space and thus the complexity of the problem. Increased complexity made application of existing drug combination dose-finding methods unsuitable in their current form.
RESULTS: Our solution to these challenges was to adapt a method based on isotonic regression to meet the research objectives of the study. Application of this adapted method is described herein, and a simulation study of the design's operating characteristics is conducted.
CONCLUSION: The aim of this article is to bring to light examples of novel design applications as a means of augmenting the implementation of innovative designs in the future and to demonstrate the flexibility of adaptive designs in satisfying changing design conditions.},

	abstract = {Purpose/Objectives Despite advances in cancer genomics, radiation therapy (RT) is still prescribed based on an empiric one-size-fits-all paradigm. Previously, we proposed a novel algorithm using the genomic adjusted radiation dose (GARD) to personalize RT prescription dose based on the biological effect of a given physical dose, calculated using individual tumor genomics. To validate the GARD-based RT dosing paradigm, we performed a pooled pan-cancer analysis in 9 separate clinical cohorts.Materials/Methods We collected 9 previously-published datasets for which all information to calculate GARD was available. Two clinical endpoints were defined: 1. time to any recurrence and 2. overall survival. The recurrence and survival analysis, included a total of 1098 (895 +RT, 203 -RT) and 821 patients (517 +RT, 304 -RT), respectively. A stratified Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed. A model was constructed in each disease site using GARD as the covariate and a common GARD effect was estimated.Results GARD is a continuous pan-cancer predictor of both recurrence and overall survival in patients treated with RT (any recurrence: coefficient =-0.019, χ-square=8.9, p =0.003; overall survival: coefficient =-0.015, χ-square=4.5, p =0.034), and was not predictive in those not treated with RT (any recurrence: coefficient =-0.033, χ-square=1.3, p =0.247; overall survival: coefficient =0.016, χ-square=2.1, p =0.148).Conclusions GARD is significantly associated with recurrence and survival in a continuous manner for the subset of patients receiving RT. We propose that a GARD-based framework should be adopted as the new paradigm for personalizing RT dose.Competing Interest StatementJGS, SAE and JFTR hold IP on RSI, GARD and RxRSI, in addition to equity in Cvergenx, a company which seeks to commercialize these methods.Funding StatementNo funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This is a retrospective analysis of published data, information on IRB approvals are contained in cited publications.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {Within paediatric populations, there may be distinct age groups characterised by different exposure-response relationships. Several regulatory guidance documents have suggested general age groupings. However, it is not clear whether these categorisations will be suitable for all new medicines and in all disease areas. We consider two model-based approaches to quantify how exposure-response model parameters vary over a continuum of ages: Bayesian penalised B-splines and model-based recursive partitioning. We propose an approach for deriving an optimal dosing rule given an estimate of how exposure-response model parameters vary with age. Methods are initially developed for a linear exposure-response model. We perform a simulation study to systematically evaluate how well the various approaches estimate linear exposure-response model parameters and the accuracy of recommended dosing rules. Simulation scenarios are motivated by an application to epilepsy drug development. Results suggest that both bootstrapped model-based recursive partitioning and Bayesian penalised B-splines can estimate underlying changes in linear exposure-response model parameters as well as (and in many scenarios, better than) a comparator linear model adjusting for a categorical age covariate with levels following International Conference on Harmonisation E11 groupings. Furthermore, the Bayesian penalised B-splines approach consistently estimates the intercept and slope more accurately than the bootstrapped model-based recursive partitioning. Finally, approaches are extended to estimate Emax exposure-response models and are illustrated with an example motivated by an in vitro study of cyclosporine.},

	abstract = {The traditional method (TM), also known as the 3+3 up-and-down design, and the continual reassessment method (CRM) are commonly used in Phase I oncology trials to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The rolling-6 is a relative newcomer which was developed to shorten trial duration by minimizing the period of time during which the trial is closed to accrual for toxicity assessment. In this manuscript we have compared the performance of these three approaches via simulations not only with respect to the usual parameters such as overall toxicity, sample size and percentage of patients treated at doses above the MTD but also in terms of trial duration and the dose chosen as the MTD. Our results indicate that the toxicity rates are comparable across the three designs, but the TM and the rolling-6 tend to treat a higher percentage of patients at doses below the MTD. With respect to trial duration, rolling-6 leads to shorter trials compared to the TM but not compared to the CRM. Additionally, the doses identified as the MTD by the TM and the rolling-6 differ in a large percentage of trials. Our results also indicate that the body surface area-based dosing used in pediatric trials can make a difference in dose escalation/de-escalation patterns in the CRM compared to the cases where such variations are not taken into account in the calculations, even leading to different MTDs in some cases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tolebrutinib is an oral, CNS-penetrant, irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, an enzyme expressed in B lymphocytes and myeloid cells including microglia, which are major drivers of inflammation in multiple sclerosis. We aimed to determine the dose-response relationship between tolebrutinib and the reduction in new active brain MRI lesions in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis.
METHODS: We did a 16-week, phase 2b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, dose-finding trial at 40 centres (academic sites, specialty clinics, and general neurology centres) in ten countries in Europe and North America. Eligible participants were adults aged 18-55 years with diagnosed relapsing multiple sclerosis (either relapsing-remitting or relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis), and one or more of the following criteria: at least one relapse within the previous year, at least two relapses within the previous 2 years, or at least one active gadolinium-enhancing brain lesion in the 6 months before screening. Exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of primary progressive multiple sclerosis or a diagnosis of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without relapse. We used a two-step randomisation process to randomly assign eligible participants (1:1) to two cohorts, then further randomly assign participants in each cohort (1:1:1:1) to four tolebrutinib dose groups (5, 15, 30, and 60 mg administered once daily as an oral tablet). Cohort 1 received tolebrutinib for 12 weeks, then matched placebo (ie, identical looking tablets) for 4 weeks; cohort 2 received 4 weeks of placebo followed by 12 weeks of tolebrutinib. Participants and investigators were masked for dose and tolebrutinib-placebo administration sequence; investigators, study team members, and study participants did not have access to unmasked data. MRI scans were done at screening and every 4 weeks over 16 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions detected on the scan done after 12 weeks of tolebrutinib treatment (assessed at week 12 for cohort 1 and week 16 for cohort 2), relative to the scan done 4 weeks previously, and compared with the lesions accumulated during 4 weeks of placebo run-in period in cohort 2. Efficacy data were analysed in a modified intention-to-treat population, using a two-step multiple comparison procedure with modelling analysis. Safety was assessed for all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03889639), EudraCT (2018-003927-12), and WHO (U1111-1220-0572), and has been completed.
FINDINGS: Between May 14, 2019, and Jan 2, 2020, we enrolled and randomly assigned 130 participants to tolebrutinib: 33 to 5 mg, 32 to 15 mg, 33 to 30 mg, and 32 to 60 mg. 129 (99\%) completed the treatment regimen and 126 were included in the primary analysis. At treatment week 12, there was a dose-dependent reduction in the number of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions (mean [SD] lesions per patient: placebo, 1·03 [2·50]; 5 mg, 1·39 [3·20]; 15 mg, 0·77 [1·48]; 30 mg, 0·76 [3·31]; 60 mg, 0·13 [0·43]; p=0·03). One serious adverse event was reported (one patient in the 60 mg group was admitted to hospital because of a multiple sclerosis relapse). The most common non-serious adverse event during tolebrutinib treatment was headache (in one [3\%] of 33 in the 5 mg group; three [9\%] of 32 in the 15 mg group; one [3\%] of 33 in the 30 mg group; and four [13\%] of 32 in the 60 mg group). No safety-related discontinuations or treatment-related deaths occurred.
INTERPRETATION: 12 weeks of tolebrutinib treatment led to a dose-dependent reduction in new gadolinium-enhancing lesions, the 60 mg dose being the most efficacious, and the drug was well tolerated. Reduction of acute inflammation, combined with the potential to modulate the immune response within the CNS, provides a scientific rationale to pursue phase 3 clinical trials of tolebrutinib in patients with relapsing and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis.

The rapid enrollment design has been proposed for dose-finding trials to find the maximum-tolerated dose where the follow-up for toxicity is long and it is desirable to assign a patient to a dose of a new therapy as soon as the patient is enrolled. We extend the rapid enrollment design to immunotherapy trials to find the optimal dose. We further describe how to use the design in immunotherapy trials with ordered groups where efficacy and safety considerations dictate running dose-finding trials in each group separately as efficacy and toxicity at the same dose can vary across groups. The estimation of the optimal dose in each of the groups can be improved in many, but not all, cases by using the monotonicity of toxicity and response among groups.},

	abstract = {Aim Dose banding is a method of dose individualisation in which all patients with similar characteristics are allocated to the same dose. Dose banding results in some patients receiving less intensive treatment which risks a reduction in therapeutic benefit (iatrogenic therapeutic failure) because of variability not predicted by dose banding. This study aims to explore the effects of dose banding on therapeutic success and failure. Methods This was a simulation study. Virtual patients were simulated under a simple pharmacokinetic model where the response of interest is the steady-state average concentration. Clearance was correlated with a covariate used for dose banding. Dose individualisation was based on: one-dose-fits-all, covariate based dosing, empirical dose banding, dose banding optimised for net therapeutic benefit and optimised for both benefit and minimising iatrogenic therapeutic failure. Results The lowest and highest probability of target attainment (PTA) were 44\% for one-dose-fits-all and 72\% for covariate-based dosing. Neither dosing approach would result in iatrogenic therapeutic failure as lower dose intensities do not occur. Empirical dose banding performed better than once-dose-fits-all with 59\% PTA but not as good as either optimised method (64-69\% PTA) while carrying a risk of iatrogenic therapeutic failure in 25\% of patients. Optimising for benefit (only) improved PTA but carried a risk of iatrogenic therapeutic failure of up to 10\%. Optimising for benefit and minimising iatrogenic therapeutic failure provided the best balance. Conclusion Future application of dose banding needs to consider both the probability of benefit as well the risk of causing iatrogenic therapeutic failure.},

	abstract = {Phase I trials often represent the first occasion where new cancer strategies are tested in patients. Various developments in cancer biology, methodology, regulation, and medical ethics have altered the ethical landscape of such trials. We provide a narrative review of contemporary ethical challenges in design, conduct, and reporting of phase I cancer trials and outline recommendations for addressing each. We organized our review around four topics, supplementing the first three with scoping reviews: (1) benefit/risk, (2) research biopsies, (3) therapeutic misconception and misestimation, and (4) reporting. The main ethical challenges of conducting phase I trials stem from three issues. First, phase I trials often involve higher research burden and scientific uncertainty compared with other cancer trials. Second, many patients arrive at phase I trials at a transitional point in their illness trajectory where they have exhausted standard survival-extending options. Third, phase I trial results play a major role in informing downstream drug development and regulatory decisions. Together, these issues create distinct pressures for study design, ethical review, informed consent, and reporting. Developments in methodology, regulation, cancer biology, and ethical awareness have helped mitigate some of these challenges, while introducing others. We conclude our review with a series of recommendations regarding trial design, ethical review, consent, and reporting. We also outline several unresolved questions that, if addressed, would strengthen the ethical foundation of phase I cancer trials.},

The aim of this educational article is to provide several opportunities to optimize anticancer drug dosing, focusing on oral targeted therapies. First, therapeutic drug monitoring can optimize exposure in individual patients, if the optimal concentration is known. This approach is of particular interest in regard to oral kinase inhibitors with high interindividual pharmacokinetic variability. If exposure is related to response, then therapeutic drug monitoring is potentially feasible, although the clinical utility of this approach has not yet been established. Other approaches to reduce variability include administration of more frequent, smaller doses and administration under optimal prandial conditions. However, for many drugs, the labeled dose has not been demonstrated to be the optimal dose; for such agents, the vast majority of patients may be receiving excessive doses, which results in excessive toxicity. Furthermore, administration of lower off-label doses may reduce both medical and financial toxicity. These strategies should be applied from registration studies to clinical practice, with the goal of better optimizing anticancer treatment.},

	abstract = {The biochemical reaction networks that regulate living systems are all stochastic to varying degrees. The resulting randomness affects biological outcomes at multiple scales, from the functional states of single proteins in a cell to the evolutionary trajectory of whole populations. Controlling how the distribution of these outcomes changes over time—via external interventions like time-varying concentrations of chemical species—is a complex challenge. In this work, we show how counterdiabatic (CD) driving, first developed to control quantum systems, provides a versatile tool for steering biological processes. We develop a practical graph-theoretic framework for CD driving in discrete-state continuous-time Markov networks. Though CD driving is limited to target trajectories that are instantaneous stationary states, we show how to generalize the approach to allow for nonstationary targets and local control—where only a subset of system states is targeted. The latter is particularly useful for biological implementations where there may be only a small number of available external control knobs, insufficient for global control. We derive simple graphical criteria for when local versus global control is possible. Finally, we illustrate the formalism with global control of a genetic regulatory switch and local control in chaperone-assisted protein folding. The derived control protocols in the chaperone system closely resemble natural control strategies seen in experimental measurements of heat shock response in yeast and E. coli.},

We conducted surveys of international stakeholders and the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) Consumer Forum to understand attitudes about patient-reported outcome (PRO) use in DFOT.A 35-question survey of clinicians, trial managers, statisticians, funders, and regulators of DFOT was distributed via professional bodies examining experience using PROs, benefits/barriers, and their potential role in defining tolerable doses. An 8-question survey of the NCRI Consumer Forum explored similar themes.International survey: 112 responses from 15 September–30 November 2020; 103 trialists [48 clinicians (42.9\%), 38 statisticians (34.0\%), 17 trial managers (15.2\%)], 7 regulators (6.3\%), 2 funders (1.8\%)]. Most trialists had no experience designing (73, 70.9\%), conducting (52, 50.5\%), or reporting (88, 85.4\%) PROs in DFOT. Most agreed that PROs could identify new toxicities (75, 67.0\%) and provide data on the frequency (86, 76.8\%) and duration (81, 72.3\%) of toxicities. The top 3 barriers were lack of guidance regarding PRO selection (73/103, 70.9\%), missing PRO data (71/103, 68.9\%), and overburdening staff (68/103, 66.0\%). NCRI survey: 57 responses on 21 March 2021. A total of 28 (49.1\%) were willing to spend \&lt;15 min/day completing PROs. Most (55, 96.5\%) preferred to complete PROs online. 61 (54.5\%) trialists and 57 (100\%) consumers agreed that patient-reported adverse events should be used to inform dose-escalation decisions.Stakeholders reported minimal experience using PROs in DFOT but broadly supported their use. Guidelines are needed to standardize PRO selection, analysis, and reporting in DFOT.},

	abstract = {Conventional phase I designs for finding a phase II recommended dose (P2RD) based on toxicity alone is problematic because the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is not necessarily the optimal dose. Instead, recently attention has been given to find the minimum effective dose (MinED) – defined as the lowest effective dose. Traditional paradigms for the MinED studies are conducted as dose-ranging or dose-response trials which involve several doses and randomize patients among doses to find the MinED. An alternative approach for the MinED study is the so-called MinED-based dose-finding study, in which instead of conducting hypothesis testings and without power analysis, this kind of trial conduct dose escalation/de-escalation to target a pre-set MinED target. In this study, we propose a new Bayesian two-stage adaptive design schema based on framework of the interval-based phase I method. The proposed method is model-free without curve pre-specifications, which is suitable for various dose-efficacy relationships. The proposed method shows desirable theoretical finite property of semi-coherence and large sample property of consistency. A random scenario generative algorithm for the MinED has also been proposed for extensive simulation studies, which demonstrated desirable performances of the proposed method. An R package “MinEDfind” and a Shiny app have been developed for implementing the method.},

	abstract = {While a number of phase I dose-finding designs in oncology exist, the commonly used ones are either algorithmic or empirical model-based. We propose a new framework for modeling the dose–response relationship, by systematically incorporating the pharmacokinetic (PK) data collected in the trial and the hypothesized mechanisms of the drug effects, via dynamic PK/PD modeling, as well as modeling of the relationship between a latent cumulative pharmacologic effect and a binary toxicity outcome. This modeling framework naturally incorporates the information on the impact of dose, schedule and method of administration (e.g., drug formulation and route of administration) on toxicity. The resulting design is an extension of existing designs that make use of pre-specified summary PK information (such as the area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] or maximum serum concentration [Cmax]). Our simulation studies show, with moderate departure from the hypothesized mechanisms of the drug action, that the performance of the proposed design on average improves upon those of the common designs, including the continual reassessment method (CRM), Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design, modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method, and a design called PKLOGIT that models the effect of the AUC on toxicity. In case of considerable departure from the underlying drug effect mechanism, the performance of the design is shown to be comparable with that of the other designs. We illustrate the proposed design by applying it to the setting of a phase I trial of a γ-secretase inhibitor in metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors. We also provide R code to implement the proposed design.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Historically, the identification of drugs with the Narrow Therapeutic Index (NTI) has been empirically based on the clinical practice. In general terms, NTI drugs can be defined based on the steepness of the dose-response relationship and the degree of overlap between the effective and the toxic concentrations.
KEY FINDINGS: The current definition in the Code of Federal Regulations is based on animal data and as such lacks direct clinical relevance. By basing these criteria on those factors that affect the degree of separation of the concentrations that elicit the therapeutic and the adverse effects, it was attempted to avoid the vagaries inherent in preparing a list of individual drugs themselves.
SUMMARY: The overall conclusions are: (1) The issue of NTI drugs is still highly controversial, (2) The lists of NTI drugs are arbitrary and (3) Variability may contribute to the safety and efficacy. The objectives are to (1) To facilitate consensus on the definition of a NTI, (2) To identify characteristics of NTI and (3) To develop criteria for identifying NTI. The FDA should consider not only the pharmacokinetics (PK) studies, but also comparative efficacy and safety studies, for the NTI drugs to further to try 'convince or educate' the prescribers.},

	abstract = {RO7297089, an anti-B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)/CD16A bispecific tetravalent antibody, is being developed as a multiple myeloma (MM) therapeutic. This study characterized nonclinical pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), soluble BCMA (sBCMA), and soluble CD16 (sCD16) changes following administration of RO7297089 to support clinical trials. Unbound and total RO7297089 concentrations were measured in cynomolgus monkeys. RO7297089 exhibited a bi-phasic systemic concentration-time profile, similar to a typical human immunoglobulin 1 antibody. Target engagement by RO7297089 led to a robust increase ({\textasciitilde}100-fold) in total systemic sBCMA levels and relatively mild increase ({\textasciitilde}2-fold) in total sCD16 levels. To describe the relationship of nonclinical PK/PD data, we developed a target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) model that includes the systemic target engagement of membrane BCMA (mBCMA), sBCMA, membrane CD16 (mCD16), and sCD16. We then used this model to simulate the PK/PD relationship of RO7297089 in MM patients by translating relevant PK parameters and target levels, based on the literature and newly generated data such as baseline sCD16A levels. Our model suggested that the impact of TMDD on RO7297089 exposure may be more significant in MM patients due to significantly higher expression levels of both mBCMA and sBCMA compared to healthy cynomolgus monkeys. Based on model simulations, we propose more frequent dosing of RO7297089 compared to regular monthly frequency in the clinic at the beginning of treatment to ensure sustained target engagement. This study demonstrates a translational research strategy for collecting relevant nonclinical data, establishing a TMDD model, and using simulations from this model to inform clinical dose regimens.},

Using multiple in vivo tumor models and clinical data, we report that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) activation in natural killer (NK) cells promoted transfer of the CAR cognate antigen from tumor to NK cells, resulting in (1) lower tumor antigen density, thus impairing the ability of CAR-NK cells to engage with their target, and (2) induced self-recognition and continuous CAR-mediated engagement, resulting in fratricide of trogocytic antigen-expressing NK cells (NKTROG+) and NK cell hyporesponsiveness. This phenomenon could be offset by a dual-CAR system incorporating both an activating CAR against the cognate tumor antigen and an NK self-recognizing inhibitory CAR that transferred a ‘don’t kill me’ signal to NK cells upon engagement with their TROG+ siblings. This system prevented trogocytic antigen-mediated fratricide, while sparing activating CAR signaling against the tumor antigen, and resulted in enhanced CAR-NK cell activity.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Oncogenic fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene alterations have been described in patients with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). This post hoc analysis assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in patients who had received first- or second-line systemic therapy for advanced/metastatic CCA before enrollment in the phase II FIGHT-202 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02924376).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic CCA with FGFR2 fusions/rearrangements (n = 107), other FGF/FGFR alterations (n = 20), or no FGF/FGFR alterations (n = 18) and documented disease progression after at least one systemic cancer therapy before enrollment in FIGHT-202 were assessed. Prior therapy and disease response data were collated from electronic case report forms. PFS was calculated for each prior line of systemic cancer therapy.
RESULTS: Among patients with FGFR2 fusions/rearrangements, other FGF/FGFR alterations, and no FGF/FGFR alterations, respectively, the median PFS with prior first-line systemic therapy was 5.5 months (95\% CI, 4.0 to 8.0; n = 102), 4.4 months (2.7 to 7.1; n = 19), and 2.8 months (1.6 to 11.3; n = 16); the median PFS with prior second-line systemic therapy was 4.2 months (3.0 to 5.3; n = 39), 3.0 months (1.1 to 9.9; n = 8), and 5.9 months (2.4 to 12.5; n = 6). The median PFS was 7.0 months (4.9 to 11.1) for patients with FGFR2 fusions/rearrangements (n = 65) with second-line pemigatinib received during the FIGHT-202 trial.
CONCLUSION: In patients with CCA and FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements, second-line treatment with pemigatinib may be associated with longer PFS compared with second-line treatment with systemic therapy received before study enrollment; however, a prospective controlled trial is required to confirm this.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The success of checkpoint blockade has led to a significant increase in the development of a broad range of immunomodulatory molecules for the treatment of cancer, including agonists against T-cell costimulatory receptors, such as OX40. Unlike checkpoint blockade, where complete and sustained receptor saturation may be required for maximal activity, the optimal dosing regimen and receptor occupancy for agonist agents is less well understood and requires further study.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We integrated both preclinical and clinical biomarker data sets centered on dose, exposure, receptor occupancy, receptor engagement, and downstream pharmacodynamic changes to model the optimal dose and schedule for the OX40 agonist antibody BMS-986178 alone and in combination with checkpoint blockade.
RESULTS: Administration of the ligand-blocking anti-mouse surrogate antibody OX40.23 or BMS-986178 as monotherapy or in combination with checkpoint blockade led to increased peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation in tumor-bearing mice and patients with solid tumors, respectively. OX40 receptor occupancy between 20\% and 50\% both in vitro and in vivo was associated with maximal enhancement of T-cell effector function by anti-OX40 treatment, whereas a receptor occupancy {\textgreater} 40\% led to a profound loss in OX40 receptor expression, with clear implications for availability for repeat dosing.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the value of an integrated translational approach applied during early clinical development to aggregate preclinical and clinical data in an effort to define the optimal dose and schedule for T-cell agonists in the clinic.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 2 gene alterations are involved in the pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma. Pemigatinib is a selective, potent, oral inhibitor of FGFR1, 2, and 3. This study evaluated the safety and antitumour activity of pemigatinib in patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with and without FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements.
METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, single-arm, multicohort, phase 2 study (FIGHT-202), patients aged 18 years or older with disease progression following at least one previous treatment and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 recruited from 146 academic or community-based sites in the USA, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia were assigned to one of three cohorts: patients with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements, patients with other FGF/FGFR alterations, or patients with no FGF/FGFR alterations. All enrolled patients received a starting dose of 13·5 mg oral pemigatinib once daily (21-day cycle; 2 weeks on, 1 week off) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or physician decision. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response among those with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements, assessed centrally in all patients who received at least one dose of pemigatinib. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02924376, and enrolment is completed.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 17, 2017, and March 22, 2019, 146 patients were enrolled: 107 with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements, 20 with other FGF/FGFR alterations, 18 with no FGF/FGFR alterations, and one with an undetermined FGF/FGFR alteration. The median follow-up was 17·8 months (IQR 11·6-21·3). 38 (35·5\% [95\% CI 26·5-45·4]) patients with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements achieved an objective response (three complete responses and 35 partial responses). Overall, hyperphosphataemia was the most common all-grade adverse event irrespective of cause (88 [60\%] of 146 patients). 93 (64\%) patients had a grade 3 or worse adverse event (irrespective of cause); the most frequent were hypophosphataemia (18 [12\%]), arthralgia (nine [6\%]), stomatitis (eight [5\%]), hyponatraemia (eight [5\%]), abdominal pain (seven [5\%]), and fatigue (seven [5\%]). 65 (45\%) patients had serious adverse events; the most frequent were abdominal pain (seven [5\%]), pyrexia (seven [5\%]), cholangitis (five [3\%]), and pleural effusion (five [3\%]). Overall, 71 (49\%) patients died during the study, most frequently because of disease progression (61 [42\%]); no deaths were deemed to be treatment related.
INTERPRETATION: These data support the therapeutic potential of pemigatinib in previously treated patients with cholangiocarcinoma who have FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements.

The current report has analyzed the dose selection approaches for 116 new molecular entities (NMEs) approved for oncology indications by the US FDA from 2010 to August 2021, with the goal to extract learnings about the ways to select the optimal dose. The analysis showed that: (1) the initial label dose was lower than the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum studied dose (MSD) in Phase 1 for the majority of approved NMEs, and that the MTD approach is no longer the mainstay for dose selection; (2) there was no dose ranging or optimization beyond Phase 1 dose escalation for {\textasciitilde} 80\% of the NMEs; (3) integrated dose/exposure-response analyses were commonly used to justify the dose selection; (4) lack of dose optimization led to dose-related PMRs/PMCs in 14\% of cases, but 82\% of these did not result in change of the initial label dose; and (5) depending on properties of the NME and specific benefit/risk considerations for the target patient population, there could be different dose selection paradigms leading to identification of the appropriate clinical dose. The analysis supports the need to incorporate more robust dose optimization during oncology clinical development, through comparative assessment of benefit/risk of multiple dose levels, over a wide exposure range using therapeutically relevant endpoints and adequate sample size. On the other hand, in certain cases, data from FIP dose escalation may be adequate to support the dose selection.},

Challenges thus arise when designing optimal clinical dose regimens for TCEs with narrow therapeutic windows, with a variety of dosing strategies being evaluated to mitigate key side effects such as cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, and on-target off-tumor toxicities. This review evaluates the current approaches to dose optimization throughout the preclinical and clinical development of TCEs, along with perspectives for improvement of these strategies.

However, first-in-patient oncology studies for molecularly targeted agents continued to evaluate escalating doses using limited number of patients per dose cohort assessing dose-limiting toxicities to identify the MTD which is commonly selected for further development adopting a 'more is better' approach that led to several post-marketing requirement (PMR) studies to evaluate alternative, typically lower, doses or dosing frequencies to optimize the benefit-risk profile.

	abstract = {Treatment of locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma involves a multidisciplinary approach that combines surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy. These curative strategies are associated with significant acute and long-term toxicities. With the emergence of human papillomavirus (HPV) as an etiologic factor associated primarily with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, higher cure rates juxtaposed with substantial treatment-related morbidity and mortality has led to interest in de-escalated therapeutic strategies, with the goal of optimizing oncologic outcomes while reducing treatment-related toxicity. Currently explored strategies include replacing, reducing, or omitting cytotoxic chemotherapy; reducing dose or volume of radiotherapy; and incorporation of less-invasive surgical approaches. Potential biomarkers to select patients for treatment de-escalation include clinical risk stratification, adjuvant de-escalation based on pathologic features, response to induction therapy, and molecular markers. The optimal patient selection and de-escalation strategy is critically important in the evolving treatment of locoregional head and neck cancer. Recently, two large phase III trials, RTOG 1016 and De-ESCALaTE, failed to de-escalate treatment in HPV-associated head and neck cancer by demonstrating inferior outcomes by replacing cisplatin with cetuximab in combination with radiation. This serves as a cautionary tale in the future design of de-escalation trials in this patient population, which will need to leverage toxicity and efficacy endpoints. Our review summarizes completed and ongoing de-escalation trials in head and neck cancer, with particular emphasis on biomarkers for patient selection and clinical trial design. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The toxicity associated with standard multimodality treatment for head and neck cancer underscores the need to seek less-intensive therapies with a reduced long-term symptom burden through de-escalated treatment paradigms that minimize toxicity while maintaining oncologic control in appropriately selected patients. Controversy regarding the optimal de-escalation strategy and criteria for patient selection for de-escalated therapy has led to multiple parallel strategies undergoing clinical investigation. Well-designed trials that optimize multimodal strategies are needed. Given the absence of positive randomized trials testing de-escalated therapy to date, practicing oncologists should exercise caution and administer established standard-of-care therapy outside the context of a clinical trial.},

Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated Project Optimus to reform the dose optimization and dose selection paradigm in oncology drug development. To accommodate this paradigm shifting, we propose a dose-ranging approach to optimizing dose (DROID) for oncology trials with targeted drugs. DROID leverages the well-established dose-ranging study framework, which has been routinely used to develop non-oncology drugs for decades, and bridges it with established oncology dose-finding designs to optimize the dose of oncology drugs. DROID consists of two seamlessly connected stages. In the first stage, patients are sequentially enrolled and adaptively assigned to investigational doses to establish the therapeutic dose range (TDR), defined as the range of doses with acceptable toxicity and efficacy profiles, and the recommended phase 2 dose set (RP2S). In the second stage, patients are randomized to the doses in RP2S to assess the dose-response relationship and identify the optimal dose. The simulation study shows that DROID substantially outperforms the conventional approach, providing a new paradigm to efficiently optimize the dose of targeted oncology drugs. DROID aligns with the approach of a randomized, parallel dose-response trial design recommended by the FDA in the Guidance on Optimizing the Dosage of Human Prescription Drugs and Biological Products for the Treatment of Oncologic Diseases.},

	issn = {1724-191X},
	doi = {10.1016/j.ejmp.2019.04.008},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Vessel-sparing radiotherapy has shown promising results in preserving erectile function (EF). Using an endorectal balloon (ERB) may help to reduce the dose to the internal pudendal arteries (IPA) by pushing the prostate forward. We tested this hypothesis and evaluated the limits of IPA dose optimization in prostate cancer patients simulated with and without ERB.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve patients with localized disease were simulated both with and without ERB. IPA were delineated on every CT after MRI registration. Planning target volumes (PTV) were planned to receive 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions with a VMAT technique. Twenty-four initial plans were generated using a knowledge-based planning software without any specific constraints for IPA. Additional stepwise optimization was performed until stabilization of the IPA dose or trespassing of PTV homogeneity limits.
RESULTS: Without optimization, the median mean IPA dose (Dmean) was lower with ERB than without (10.5 vs. 12.8 Gy, p = 0.023). After optimization, the IPA Dmean dropped significantly (from 11.1 to 4.8 Gy) without impairing the PTV dose homogeneity and the organs at risk dose constraints. The comparison of the best-optimized plans with and without ERB showed an optimal sparing of IPA using ERB (28\% mean dose reduction, p = 0.006; median Dmean of 4.1 Gy vs. 5.7 Gy with and without ERB, respectively).
CONCLUSION: IPA dose sparing is feasible without compromising dose prescription and constraints. ERB significantly reduced the dose on IPA compared to plans generated without ERB. As no specific constraints are available for vessel-sparing SBRT, optimal IPA dose reduction should be recommended to maximize EF preservation.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate potential organ at risk dose-sparing by using dose-mass-histogram (DMH) objective functions compared with dose-volume-histogram (DVH) objective functions.
METHODS: Treatment plans were retrospectively optimized for 10 locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients based on DVH and DMH objectives. DMH-objectives were the same as DVH objectives, but with mass replacing volume. Plans were normalized to dose to 95\% of the PTV volume (PTV-D95v) or mass (PTV-D95m). For a given optimized dose, DVH and DMH were intercompared to ascertain dose-to-volume vs. dose-to-mass differences. Additionally, the optimized doses were intercompared using DVH and DMH metrics to ascertain differences in optimized plans. Mean dose to volume, Dv‾, mean dose to mass, DM‾, and fluence maps were intercompared.
RESULTS: For a given dose distribution, DVH and DMH differ by {\textgreater}5\% in heterogeneous structures. In homogeneous structures including heart and spinal cord, DVH and DMH are nearly equivalent. At fixed PTV-D95v, DMH-optimization did not significantly reduce dose to OARs but reduced PTV-Dv‾ by 0.20±0.2Gy (p=0.02) and PTV-DM‾ by 0.23±0.3Gy (p=0.02). Plans normalized to PTV-D95m also result in minor PTV dose reductions and esophageal dose sparing (Dv‾ reduced 0.45±0.5Gy, p=0.02 and DM‾ reduced 0.44±0.5Gy, p=0.02) compared to DVH-optimized plans. Optimized fluence map comparisons indicate that DMH optimization reduces dose in the periphery of lung PTVs.
CONCLUSIONS: DVH- and DMH-dose indices differ by {\textgreater}5\% in lung and lung target volumes for fixed dose distributions, but optimizing DMH did not reduce dose to OARs. The primary difference observed in DVH- and DMH-optimized plans were variations in fluence to the periphery of lung target PTVs, where low density lung surrounds tumor.},

Several approved MTAs have been poorly tolerated during long-term administration, leading to postmarketing dose optimization studies to re-evaluate the optimal treatment dose. Using data from completed bortezomib dose-finding trials, we explore its toxicity profile, optimize its dose, and examine the appropriateness of current designs for identifying an optimal dose.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We classified the toxicities captured from 481 patients in 14 bortezomib dose-finding studies conducted through the National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, computed the incidence of late-onset toxicities, and compared the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) among groups of patients receiving different doses of bortezomib.
RESULTS: A total of 13,008 toxicities were captured: 46\% of patients' first DLTs and 88\% of dose reductions or discontinuations of treatment because of toxicity were observed after the first cycle. Moreover, for the approved dose of 1.3 mg/m(2), the estimated cumulative incidence of DLT was {\textgreater} 50\%, and the estimated cumulative incidence of dose reduction or treatment discontinuation because of toxicity was nearly 40\%.
CONCLUSIONS: When considering the entire course of treatment, the approved bortezomib dose exceeds the conventional ceiling DLT rate of 20\% to 33\%. Retrospective analysis of trial data provides an opportunity for dose optimization of MTAs. Future dose-finding studies of MTAs should take into account late-onset toxicities to ensure that a tolerable dose is identified for future efficacy and comparative trials.},

We reviewed US Food and Drug Administration initial approvals (2019-2021) of small molecules and antibody-drug conjugates for oncologic indications to determine the proportion with a recommended dosage at the maximum tolerated dose or the maximal administered dose, to characterize the use of randomized evaluations of multiple dosages in dose selection, to describe the frequency of dose modifications at the recommended dosage, and to identify case examples that highlight key principles for premarket dose optimization during drug development. Herein, we highlight major principles for dose optimization and review examples of recent US Food and Drug Administration approvals that illustrate how investigation of dose- and exposure-response relationships and use of randomized dose trials can support dose optimization. Although there has been some progress, dose optimization through randomized dose evaluation in oncology trials is not routinely conducted.

              In the era of targeted therapy, there has been increasing concern about the development of oncology drugs based on the “more is better” paradigm, developed decades ago for chemotherapy. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated Project Optimus to reform the dose optimization and dose selection paradigm in oncology drug development.

              ose (DROID) for oncology trials with targeted drugs. DROID leverages the well‐established dose‐ranging study framework, which has been routinely used to develop non‐oncology drugs for decades, and bridges it with established oncology dose‐finding designs to optimize the dose of oncology drugs. DROID consists of two seamlessly connected stages. In the first stage, patients are sequentially enrolled and adaptively assigned to investigational doses to establish the therapeutic dose range (TDR), defined as the range of doses with acceptable toxicity and efficacy profiles, and the recommended phase 2 dose set (RP2S). In the second stage, patients are randomized to the doses in RP2S to assess the dose–response relationship and identify the optimal dose. The simulation study shows that DROID substantially outperforms the conventional approach, providing a new paradigm to efficiently optimize the dose of targeted oncology drugs. DROID aligns with the approach of a randomized, parallel dose‐response trial design recommended by the FDA in the Guidance on Optimizing the Dosage of Human Prescription Drugs and Biological Products for the Treatment of Oncologic Diseases.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE
              Novel Bayesian adaptive designs provide an effective way to improve clinical trial efficiency. These designs are superior to conventional methods, but implementing them can be challenging. The aim of this article was to describe what we learned while applying a novel Bayesian phase I-II design in a recent trial.
            
            
              METHODS
              The primary goal of the trial was to optimize radiation therapy (RT) dose among three levels (low, standard, and high), given either with placebo (P) or an investigational agent (A), for treating locally advanced, radiation-naive pancreatic cancer, deemed appropriate for RT rather than surgery. Up to 48 patients were randomly assigned fairly between RT plus P and RT plus A, with RT dose-finding done within each arm using the late-onset efficacy-toxicity design on the basis of two coprimary end points, tumor response and dose-limiting toxicity, both evaluated at up to 90 days. The random assignment was blinded, but within each arm, unblinded RT doses were chosen adaptively using software developed within the institution.
            
            
              RESULTS
              Implementing the design involved double-blind balance-restricted random assignment, real-time assessment of patient outcomes to evaluate the efficacy-toxicity trade-off for each RT dose in each arm to optimize each patient's RT dose adaptively, and transition from a single-center trial to a multicenter trial. We present lessons learned and illustrative documentation.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Implementing novel Bayesian adaptive trial designs requires close collaborations between physicians, pharmacists, statisticians, data managers, and sponsors. The process is difficult but manageable and essential for efficient trial conduct. Close collaboration during trial conduct is a key component of any trial that includes real-time adaptive decision rules.},

            Conventional designs for choosing a dose for a new therapy may select doses that are unsafe or ineffective, and fail to optimize progression free survival time, overall survival time, or remission duration. We explain and illustrate limitations of conventional dose finding designs, and make four recommendations to address these problems. When feasible, a dose-finding design should account for long-term outcomes, include screening rules that drop unsafe or ineffective doses, enroll an adequate sample size, and randomize patients among doses. As illustrations, we review three designs that include one or more of these features. The first illustration is a trial that randomized patients among two cell therapy doses and standard of care in a setting where it was assumed on biological grounds that dose-toxicity and dose-response curves did not necessarily increase with cell dose. The second design generalizes phase 1-2 by first identifying a set of candidate doses, rather than one dose, randomizing additional patients among the candidates, and selecting an optimal dose to maximize progression free survival over a longer follow up period. The third design combines a phase 1-2 trial and a group sequential randomized phase 3 trial by using survival time data available after the first stage of phase 3 to re-optimize the dose selected in phase 1-2. By incorporating one or more of the recommended features, these designs improve the likelihood that a selected dose or schedule will be optimal, and thus will benefit future patients and obtain regulatory approval.},

            Designs for early phase dose finding clinical trials typically are either phase I based on toxicity, or phase I‐II based on toxicity and efficacy. These designs rely on the implicit assumption that the dose of an experimental agent chosen using these short‐term outcomes will maximize the agent's long‐term therapeutic success rate. In many clinical settings, this assumption is not true. A dose selected in an early phase oncology trial may give suboptimal progression‐free survival or overall survival time, often due to a high rate of relapse following response. To address this problem, a new family of Bayesian generalized phase I‐II designs is proposed. First, a conventional phase I‐II design based on short‐term outcomes is used to identify a set of candidate doses, rather than selecting one dose. Additional patients then are randomized among the candidates, patients are followed for a predefined longer time period, and a final dose is selected to maximize the long‐term therapeutic success rate, defined in terms of duration of response. Dose‐specific sample sizes in the randomization are determined adaptively to obtain a desired level of selection reliability. The design was motivated by a phase I‐II trial to find an optimal dose of natural killer cells as targeted immunotherapy for recurrent or treatment‐resistant B‐cell hematologic malignancies. A simulation study shows that, under a range of scenarios in the context of this trial, the proposed design has much better performance than two conventional phase I‐II designs.},

            The goal of dose optimization during drug development is to identify a dose that preserves clinical benefit with optimal tolerability. Traditionally, the maximum tolerated dose in a small phase I dose escalation study is used in the phase II trial assessing clinical activity of the agent. Although it is possible that this dose level could be altered in the phase II trial if an unexpected level of toxicity is seen, no formal dose optimization has routinely been incorporated into later stages of drug development. Recently it has been suggested that formal dose optimization (involving randomly assigning patients between 2 or more dose levels) be routinely performed early in drug development, even before it is known that the experimental therapy has any clinical activity at any dose level. We consider the relative merits of performing dose optimization earlier vs later in the drug development process and demonstrate that a considerable number of patients may be exposed to ineffective therapies unless dose optimization is delayed until after clinical activity or benefit of the new agent has been established. We conclude that patient and public health interests may be better served by conducting dose optimization after (or during) phase III evaluation, with some exceptions when dose optimization should be performed after activity shown in phase II evaluation.},

              Dose–response analysis is often applied to the quantification of drug‐effect especially for slowly responding disease end points where a comparison is made across dose levels after a particular period of treatment. It has long been recognized that exposure – response is more appropriate than dose–response. However, trials necessarily are designed as dose–response experiments. Second, a wide range of functional forms are used to express relationships between dose and response. These considerations are also important for clinical development because pharmacokinetic (PK; and variability) plus pharmacokinetic‐pharmacodynamic modeling may allow one to anticipate the shape of the dose–response curve and so the trial design. Here, we describe how the location and steepness of the dose response is determined by the PKs of the compound being tested and its exposure‐response relationship in terms of potency (location), efficacy (maximum effect) and Hill coefficient (steepness). Thus, the location (50\% effective dose [ED
              50
              ]) is dependent not only on the potency (half‐maximal effective concentration) but also the compound's PKs. Similarly, the steepness of the dose response is shown to be a function of the half‐life of the drug. It is also shown that the shape of relationship varies dependent on the assumed time course of the disease. This is important in the context of drug‐discovery where the in vivo potencies of compounds are compared as well as when considering an analysis of summary data (for example, model‐based meta‐analysis) for clinical decision making.},

            Establishing a dosing regimen that maximizes clinical benefit and minimizes adverse effects for novel therapeutics is a key objective for drug developers. Finding an optimal dose and schedule can be particularly challenging for compounds with a narrow therapeutic window such as in oncology. Modeling and simulation tools can be valuable to conduct in silico evaluations of various dosing scenarios with the goal to identify those that could minimize toxicities, avoid unscheduled dose interruptions, or minimize premature discontinuations, which all could limit the potential for therapeutic benefit. In this tutorial, we present a stepwise development of an adaptive dose simulation framework that can be used for dose optimization simulations. The tutorial first describes the general workflow, followed by a technical description with basic to advanced practical examples of its implementation in mrgsolve and is concluded with examples on how to use this in decision‐making around dose and schedule optimization. The adaptive simulation framework is built with pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic (i.e., biomarkers, activity markers, target engagement markers, efficacy markers), and safety models that include evaluations of unexplained interindividual and intraindividual variability and covariate impact, which can be replaced and expanded (e.g., combination setting, comparator setting) with user‐defined models. Subsequent adaptive simulations allow investigation of the impact of starting dose, dosing intervals, and event‐driven (exposure or effect) dose modifications on any end point. The resulting simulation‐derived insights can be used in quantitatively proposing dose and regimens that better balance benefit and adverse effects for further evaluation, aiding dose selection discussions, and designing dose modification recommendations, among others.},

            Consensus guidelines recommend use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor in patients deemed at risk of chemotherapy‐induced neutropenia, however, these risk models are limited in the factors they consider and miss some cases of neutropenia. Clinical decision making could be supported using models that better tailor their predictions to the individual patient using the wealth of data available in electronic health records (EHRs). Here, we present a hybrid pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD)/machine learning (ML) approach that uses predictions and individual Bayesian parameter estimates from a PKPD model to enrich an ML model built on her data. We demonstrate this approach using models developed on a large real‐world data set of 9121 patients treated for lymphoma, breast, or thoracic cancer. We also investigate the benefits of augmenting the training data using synthetic data simulated with the PKPD model. We find that PKPD‐enrichment of ML models improves prediction of grade 3–4 neutropenia, as measured by higher precision (61\%) and recall (39\%) compared to PKPD model predictions (47\%, 33\%) or base ML model predictions (51\%, 31\%). PKPD augmentation of ML models showed minor improvements in recall (44\%) but not precision (56\%), and data augmentation required careful tuning to control overfitting its predictions to the PKPD model. PKPD enrichment of ML shows promise for leveraging both the physiology‐informed predictions of PKPD and the ability of ML to learn predictor‐outcome relationships from large data sets to predict patient response to drugs in a clinical precision dosing context.},

            Autologous Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR‐T) cell therapy has been highly successful in the treatment of aggressive hematological malignancies and is also being evaluated for the treatment of solid tumors as well as other therapeutic areas. A challenge, however, is that up to 60\% of patients do not sustain a long‐term response. Low CAR‐T cell exposure has been suggested as an underlying factor for a poor prognosis. CAR‐T cell therapy is a novel therapeutic modality with unique kinetic and dynamic properties. Importantly, “clear” dose‐exposure relationships do not seem to exist for any of the currently approved CAR‐T cell products. In other words, dose increases have not led to a commensurate increase in the measurable in vivo frequency of transferred CAR‐T cells. Therefore, alternative approaches beyond dose titration are needed to optimize CAR‐T cell exposure. In this paper, we provide examples of actionable variables – design elements in CAR‐T cell discovery, development, and clinical practice, which can be modified to optimize autologous CAR‐T cell exposure. Most of these actionable variables can be assessed throughout the various stages of discovery and development as part of a well‐informed research and development program. Model‐informed drug development approaches can enable such study and program design choices from discovery through to clinical practice and can be an important contributor to cell therapy effectiveness and efficiency.},

            Despite the growing appreciation that the future of cancer treatment lies in combination therapies, finding the right drugs to combine and the optimal way to combine them remains a nontrivial task. Herein, we introduce the Multi‐Objective Optimization of Combination Synergy – Dose Selection (MOOCS‐DS) method for using drug synergy as a tool for guiding dose selection for a combination of preselected compounds. This method decouples synergy of potency (SoP) and synergy of efficacy (SoE) and identifies Pareto optimal solutions in a multi‐objective synergy space. Using a toy combination therapy model, we explore properties of the MOOCS‐DS algorithm, including how optimal dose selection can be influenced by the metric used to define SoP and SoE. We also demonstrate the potential of our approach to guide dose and schedule selection using a model fit to preclinical data of the combination of the PD‐1 checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab and the anti‐angiogenic drug bevacizumab on two lung cancer cell lines. The identification of optimally synergistic combination doses has the potential to inform preclinical experimental design and improve the success rates of combination therapies.

            Copanlisib dose selection was established under the maximum tolerated dose paradigm, and no dedicated dose‐finding studies have investigated copanlisib dose selection when used in combination with rituximab. In CHRONOS‐3, copanlisib plus rituximab demonstrated significantly improved progression‐free survival versus placebo plus rituximab in patients with relapsed indolent non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL). We conducted a comprehensive investigation of copanlisib population pharmacokinetics (PopPK) from a pooled analysis of 712 patients across nine copanlisib phase I–III studies and exposure–response (ER) relationships for efficacy and safety from the 1‐year follow‐up of CHRONOS‐3. PopPK analyses examined the impact of demographic, laboratory, and comedication covariates on copanlisib between‐patient PK variability. Individual static and time‐varying exposure estimates were derived to investigate exposure–efficacy and exposure–safety relationships. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression analyses examined ER relationships with consideration of predefined potentially prognostic demographic‐, laboratory‐, and/or disease‐related baseline covariates. Copanlisib PK were best described by a three‐compartment model with first‐order elimination. Individual identified covariates had modest effects on copanlisib PK and were generally in line with known copanlisib disposition properties. In CHRONOS‐3, ER analyses showed a significant relationship between time‐varying exposure estimates and progression‐free survival, and no significant exposure–safety relationships. Thus, lower copanlisib doses may result in reduced efficacy but not necessarily improved safety or tolerability. These outcomes substantiate the current intermittent dosing regimen of copanlisib 60 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28‐day cycle and support the observed clinical results of copanlisib in combination with rituximab in the iNHL population.},

Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling describes the biological mechanisms of disease and the mode of action of drugs with mathematical equations, which has significant potential to address the big challenges in the IO field, from identifying patient populations that respond to different therapies to guiding the selection, dosing, and scheduling of combination therapy. To assess the perspectives of the community on the impact of QSP modeling in IO drug development and to understand current applications and challenges, the IO QSP working group—under the QSP Special Interest Group (SIG) of the International Society of Pharmacometrics (ISoP)—conducted a survey among QSP modelers, non‐QSP modelers, and non‐modeling IO program stakeholders. The survey results are presented here with discussions on how to address some of the findings. One of the findings is the differences in perception among these groups. To help bridge this perception gap, we present several case studies demonstrating the impact of QSP modeling in IO and suggest actions that can be taken in the future to increase the real and perceived impact of QSP modeling in IO drug research and development.},

            Background: Dosage optimization (DO) is a critical aspect of oncology drug development. Because of this, the US FDA, through Project Optimus, has focused on reforming the DO and dosage selection paradigm for oncology products. When approving products, FDA may determine that although the recommended dosage possesses a favorable benefit:risk (BR) profile, there are significant safety concerns that require evaluation of alternative dosages to potentially improve the BR profile. Such postmarketing requirements (PMRs)—issued as a condition of approval—are examined here to better understand the characteristics and potential limitations of DO studies in the postmarketing setting. Methods: Between Jan. 1, 2010 to Dec. 31, 2022, oncology new molecular entities (NMEs) and original applications for biologics, hereafter referred to as new drugs, approved by CDER with at least one PMR issued for DO were identified in the FDA electronic records database. The designs and results of the associated trials or analyses for these PMRs, along with the status of the PMRs, were collected and evaluated. Results: There were 24 PMRs issued for 21 new drugs (15\% of 138 total approved new drugs). The most common drug classes were: tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (10), antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) (3), or GTPase Inhibitors (2). The following trials or analyses were planned to address these PMRs: randomized dose-comparison trials (18), non-randomized dose-finding trials (2), food effect trials (2), exposure-response analysis (1), and pending (1). The planned sample sizes for the 18 dose-comparison trials were 3 with {\textless}100 patients, 4 with 100 to 199 patients, 7 with 200 to 500 patients, and 4 with {\textgreater}500 patients. The dose-comparison trials used the following (co)primary endpoints: response rate (12), safety (7), OS (3), and PFS (2). Fourteen PMRs were either fulfilled (11) or released (3). Of the 11 fulfilled PMRs, 8 led to dosage changes for 5 new drugs (cabazitaxel, carfilzomib, ponatinib, ceritinib, and pexidartinib), and 3 did not lead to dosage changes. Ten PMRs are ongoing. The median time from issuance to fulfillment or release (not including ongoing PMRs) was 6 years (range: 0.7 to 8.3). Conclusions: A high proportion (15\%) of new drugs required a PMR, which generally involved conducting a randomized trial with a substantial patient enrollment to evaluate an alternative dosage(s). This process was slow with a median of 6 years to fulfill a PMR. DO in the premarket setting has the potential to rapidly maximize BR, avoiding both patient exposure to unnecessary toxicity and large, resource-intensive, multi-year postmarketing trials. Project Optimus is working with stakeholders to advance a DO paradigm that occurs early and throughout premarket development to ensure an optimized recommended dosage at the time of approval.},

	abstract = {Since the middle of the 20th century, oncology’s dose-finding paradigm has been oriented toward identifying a drug’s maximum tolerated dose, which is then carried forward into phase 2 and 3 trials and clinical practice. For most modern precision medicines, however, maximum tolerated dose is far greater than the minimum dose needed to achieve maximal benefit, leading to unnecessary side effects. Regulatory change may decrease maximum tolerated dose’s predominance by enforcing dose optimization of new drugs. Dozens of already approved cancer drugs require re-evaluation, however, introducing a new methodologic and ethical challenge in cancer clinical trials. In this article, we assess the history and current landscape of cancer drug dose finding. We provide a set of strategic priorities for postapproval dose optimization trials of the future. We discuss ethical considerations for postapproval dose optimization trial design and review three major design strategies for these unique trials that would both adhere to ethical standards and benefit patients and funders. We close with a discussion of financial and reporting considerations in the realm of dose optimization. Taken together, we provide a comprehensive, bird’s eye view of the postapproval dose optimization trial landscape and offer our thoughts on the next steps required of methodologies and regulatory and funding regimes.},

In this program, the imperative operations of the protocol emerge as consequences of clinically meaningful anticipatory-regret scenarios that are declared as CLP(Z) constraints. This 'regret-constrained' (RC) specification yields a robust formulation which can be used to prove clinically meaningful safety and liveness properties of the protocol before incorporating it into a trial, and then as an on-line decision support system while the trial is underway. Our RC specification also readily accommodates certain pragmatic modifications to trial enrollment which severely strain traditionally imperative formulations. The features of modern Prolog systems let us describe the 3 + 3 protocol with a short and general program that has desirable algebraic properties and can therefore be used, tested and reasoned about in several different ways.},

	abstract = {Importance
              The US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) accelerated approval pathway allows approval of investigational drugs treating unmet medical needs based on changes to surrogate measures considered “reasonably likely” to predict clinical benefit. Postapproval clinical trials are then required to confirm whether these drugs offer clinical benefit.
            
            
              Objective
              To determine whether cancer drugs granted accelerated approval ultimately demonstrate clinical benefit and to evaluate the basis of conversion to regular approval.
            
            
              Design, Setting, and Participants
              In this cohort study, publicly available FDA data were used to identify cancer drugs granted accelerated approval from 2013 to 2023.
            
            
              Main Outcomes and Measures
              Demonstrated improvement in quality of life or overall survival in accelerated approvals with more than 5 years of follow-up, as well as confirmatory trial end points and time to conversion for drug-indication pairs converted to regular approval.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 129 cancer drug–indication pairs were granted accelerated approval from 2013 to 2023. Among 46 indications with more than 5 years of follow-up (approved 2013-2017), approximately two-thirds (29, 63\%) were converted to regular approval, 10 (22\%) were withdrawn, and 7 (15\%) remained ongoing after a median of 6.3 years. Fewer than half (20/46, 43\%) demonstrated a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Time to withdrawal decreased from 9.9 years to 3.6 years, and time to regular approval increased from 1.6 years to 3.6 years. Among 48 drug-indication pairs converted to regular approval, 19 (40\%) were converted based on overall survival, 21 (44\%) on progression-free survival, 5 (10\%) on response rate plus duration of response, 2 (4\%) on response rate, and 1 (2\%) despite a negative confirmatory trial. Comparing accelerated and regular approval indications, 18 of 48 (38\%) were unchanged, while 30 of 48 (63\%) had different indications (eg, earlier line of therapy).
            
            
              Conclusions and Relevance
              Most cancer drugs granted accelerated approval did not demonstrate benefit in overall survival or quality of life within 5 years of accelerated approval. Patients should be clearly informed about the cancer drugs that use the accelerated approval pathway and do not end up showing benefits in patient-centered clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {Many targeted therapies are administered at or near the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). With the advent of precision medicine, a larger therapeutic window is expected. Therefore, dose optimization will require a new approach to early clinical trial design. We analyzed publicly available data for 21 therapies targeting six kinases, and four poly (ADP‐ribose) polymerase inhibitors, focusing on potency and exposure to gain insight into dose selection. The free average steady‐state concentration (C
              ss
              ) at the approved dose was compared to the
              in vitro
              cell potency (half‐maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
              50
              )). Average steady‐state area under the plasma concentration‐time curve, the fraction unbound drug in plasma, and the cell potency were taken from the US drug labels, US and European regulatory reviews, and peer‐reviewed journal articles. The C
              ss
              was remarkably similar to the IC
              50
              . The median C
              ss
              /IC
              50
              value was 1.2, and 76\% of the values were within 3‐fold of unity. However, three drugs (encorafenib, erlotinib, and ribociclib) had a C

              /IC

              /IC
              50
              values ranging from 0.5 to 4. These data suggest that these kinase inhibitors have a large therapeutic window that is not fully exploited; lower doses may be similarly efficacious with improved tolerability. We propose a revised first‐in‐human trial design in which dose cohort expansion is initiated at doses less than the MTD when there is evidence of clinical activity and C
              ss
              exceeds a potency threshold. This potency‐guided approach is expected to maximize the therapeutic window thereby improving patient outcomes.},

              WNT974 is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable first‐in‐class inhibitor of Porcupine, a membrane‐bound O‐acyltransferase required for Wnt secretion, currently under clinical development in oncology. A phase I clinical trial is being conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors. During the dose‐escalation part, various dosing regimens, including once or twice daily continuous and intermittent dosing at a dose range of 5–45 mg WNT974 were studied, however, the protocol‐defined maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not established based on dose‐limiting toxicity. To assist in the selection of the recommended dose for expansion (RDE), a model‐based approach was utilized. It integrated population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and exposure–response analyses of a target‐inhibition biomarker, skin
              AXIN2
              mRNA expression, and the occurrence of the adverse event, dysgeusia. The target exposure range of WNT974 that would provide a balance between target inhibition and tolerability was estimated based on exposure–response analyses. The dose that was predicted to yield an exposure within the target exposure range was selected as RDE. This model‐based approach integrated PK, biomarker, and safety data to determine the RDE and represented an alternative as opposed to the conventional MTD approach for selecting an optimal biological dose. The strategy can be broadly applied to select doses in early oncology trials and inform translational clinical oncology drug development.},

	abstract = {Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) provide targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents directly inside tumor cells. However, many ADCs targeting solid tumors have exhibited limited clinical efficacy, in part, due to insufficient penetration within tumors. To better understand the relationship between ADC tumor penetration and efficacy, previously applied Krogh cylinder models that explore tumor growth dynamics following ADC administration in preclinical species were expanded to a clinical framework by integrating clinical pharmacokinetics, tumor penetration, and tumor growth inhibition. The objective of this framework is to link ADC tumor penetration and distribution to clinical efficacy. The model was validated by comparing virtual patient population simulations to observed overall response rates from trastuzumab‐DM1 treated patients with metastatic breast cancer. To capture clinical outcomes, we expanded upon previous Krogh cylinder models to include the additional mechanism of heterogeneous tumor growth inhibition spatially across the tumor. This expansion mechanistically captures clinical response rates by describing heterogeneous ADC binding and tumor cell killing; high binding and tumor cell death close to capillaries vs. low binding, and high tumor cell proliferation far from capillaries. Sensitivity analyses suggest that clinical efficacy could be optimized through dose fractionation, and that clinical efficacy is primarily dependent on the ADC‐target affinity, payload potency, and tumor growth rate. This work offers a mechanistic basis to predict and optimize ADC clinical efficacy for solid tumors, allowing dosing strategy optimization to improve patient outcomes.},

            Phase I oncology clinical trials often comprise a limited number of patients representing different disease subtypes who are divided into cohorts receiving treatment(s) at different dosing levels and schedules. Here, we leverage a previously developed quantitative systems pharmacology model of the anti‐CD20/CD3 T‐cell engaging bispecific antibody, mosunetuzumab, to account for different dosing regimens and patient heterogeneity in the phase I study to inform clinical dose/exposure‐response relationships and to identify biological determinants of clinical response. We developed a novel workflow to generate digital twins for each patient, which together form a virtual population (VPOP) that represented variability in biological, pharmacological, and tumor‐related parameters from the phase I trial. Simulations based on the VPOP predict that an increase in mosunetuzumab exposure increases the proportion of digital twins with at least a 50\% reduction in tumor size by day 42. Simulations also predict a left‐shift of the exposure‐response in patients diagnosed with indolent compared to aggressive non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype; this increased sensitivity in indolent NHL was attributed to the lower inferred values of tumor proliferation rate and baseline T‐cell infiltration in the corresponding digital twins. Notably, the inferred digital twin parameters from clinical responders and nonresponders show that the potential biological difference that can influence response include tumor parameters (tumor size, proliferation rate, and baseline T‐cell infiltration) and parameters defining the effect of mosunetuzumab on T‐cell activation and B‐cell killing. Finally, the model simulations suggest intratumor expansion of pre‐existing T‐cells, rather than an influx of systemically expanded T‐cells, underlies the antitumor activity of mosunetuzumab.},

            Project Optimus is a US Food and Drug Administration Oncology Center of Excellence initiative aimed at reforming the dose selection and optimization paradigm in oncology drug development. This project seeks to bring together pharmaceutical companies, international regulatory agencies, academic institutions, patient advocates, and other stakeholders. Although there is much promise in this initiative, there are several challenges that need to be addressed, including multidimensionality of the dose optimization problem in oncology, the heterogeneity of cancer and patients, importance of evaluating long‐term tolerability beyond dose‐limiting toxicities, and the lack of reliable biomarkers for long‐term efficacy. Through the lens of Totality of Evidence and with the mindset of model‐informed drug development, we offer insights into dose optimization by building a quantitative knowledge base integrating diverse sources of data and leveraging quantitative modeling tools to build evidence for drug dosage considering exposure, disease biology, efficacy, toxicity, and patient factors. We believe that rational dose optimization can be achieved in oncology drug development, improving patient outcomes by maximizing therapeutic benefit while minimizing toxicity.},
