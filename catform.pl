/*
It's time now to investigate what trial designs arise from
a rectified tally-dose mapping.  We are looking for all
incremental enrollments that are consistent with the
preorder obtained 
*/

% Some good visualizations would seem to be necessary now
% to promote efficient progress.  What Hasse diagrams could
% we draw for the partial order ‚âº restricted to final tallies?
% Note that it could be interesting to define Hasse diagrams
% declaratively, and have Prolog find *all* of them for me.
% But to begin, let's explore some special solutions yielded
% by specific heuristics.

% At least for the D=2 case, a useful Hasse diagram for ùí¨f seems within reach.
% One thing that could be of special help would be finding small sets of q's
% that share the same covered and covering elements, since these could be
% collected into single nodes of the Hasse diagram.
% As a step toward finding any such little collections, let me partition ùí¨f
% into a list of recursively peeled-off minimal sets.

% Thus, it seems k'th element of Hs ranges from -k*Nmax to 0.
% This is at least rather simple!  But the Os look a bit more
% complicated in this respect.
% ---
% And, as expected, the Hs have not changed, since only the
% top, right block --- (Œ≥,œÉ's) vs (u's) --- of our inverse
% matrix has changed.

%?- coefs(3, [6/6,6/6,6/6,6/6], Hs, Os).
%@    Hs = [-6,-12,-18,-24], Os = [-72,-78,-84,-90].
%?- coefs(2, [6/6,6/6,6/6,6/6], Hs, Os).
%@    Hs = [-6,-12,-18,-24], Os = [-48,-54,-60,-66].
%?- coefs(1, [6/6,6/6,6/6,6/6], Hs, Os).
%@    Hs = [-6,-12,-18,-24], Os = [-24,-30,-36,-42].
% Can we understand the above, in light of the formulae?
% Our Œ≥ = -r‚àët + ‚àëu should have minimum value -6rD, and
% maximum value 6D.  Each subsequent element of (Œ≥,œÉ's)
% (i.e., the œÉ's in turn) can be no higher, and at most
% 6D lower, than its predecessor.

% But we can say even more about the upper limits,
% since these are attained in the case t‚Çñ‚â°0!  The
% upper limits are therefore independent of r, and
% just the same descending sequence found for r=1.
%?- coefs(3, [0/6,0/6,0/6,0/6], Hs, Os).
%@    Hs = [0,0,0,0], Os = [24,18,12,6].
%?- coefs(2, [0/6,0/6,0/6,0/6], Hs, Os).

%?- coefs(1, [0/6,0/6,0/6,0/6], Hs, Os).
%@    Hs = [0,0,0,0], Os = [24,18,12,6].

% Therefore, the _range_ of Os (which is what matters
% in determining the bases of our 'digits') are all
% equal at 6D(r+1).
% Accordingly, we need only update os_base/2 below.

% Let's now check this encoding, to be sure it embeds every
% arrow of ‚âº.

% By embedding the partial order ‚âº into a *complete* order,
% I could sort ùí¨f so that all arrows of ‚âº point left-to-right.
% Then, minimal sets would be in contiguous stretches of this
% sorted list, and identifying the partitions could be done
% potentially quite efficiently.

% I would expect that this list of (recursively) minimal sets
% would itself be useful for computing the covering relation.
% (Exactly *how* it would help remains to be discovered.)

% One way to obtain a complete order would be to arithmetize
% the tallies.


% Contrary to my presumptions in that last commit, our
% previous encoding should be retained, and continues
% to support sorting of the Qs by their unique keys.
% A clearer accounting for how and why this works is
% sorely needed, however!
%
% Keeping in mind that ‚âº is in fact a _partial order_,
% which justifies the use of '‚â∫' for '‚âº ‚àñ =', we want
% to ensure that
%
%    q ‚â∫ q' ‚üπ K(q) < K(q')  ‚àÄ q, q'‚àà ùí¨,
%
% so that the Key sorting can discriminate between q's
% sharing the same Ts profile but differing in the Us.
% (The weaker implication ‚âº ‚üπ ‚â§ simply won't suffice.)

% The guarantee I have regarding such a sorted Qf list is that,

/*
From the above, we see that (as expected) a separate 'rectification'
step is not truly needed, and that the calculation of candidate g's
automatically ensures functoriality of the resulting lower-Galois
enrollment.

That represents progress toward simplification, but (apparently)
not toward improved time-complexity, nor even a substantial speedup.

One thing we might do, however, is to incorporate the minimization
into the search itself.  If we already have a non-empty set of
valid g‚Çì's that are minimal among those found thus far, then any
new g' that we might like to test can be rejected immediately if
it exceeds *any* element of this set.  Such quick rejection will
avoid costly checking against _all_ of the Qls1.

What if I were scanning a *sorted* list of all admissible tallies?
Would I enjoy any guarantee that allowed me to cut short my scan
at any point?  How might I know that I won't find any additional
minimal g‚Çì's for some given x?

Suppose I search a list sorted low-to-high along -‚âº-> arrows,
and find a valid g‚Çì that is however not minimal relative to the
g‚Çì's I've already found.  Could this guarantee I will never find
another minimal g‚Çì further along (higher up) the list?  I think
that's too much to hope for.

But what about the question of minimality?  Because I can never
find a later element in the list that is _below_ a previously
seen element (including any g‚Çì's collected thus far), I do know
that none of the g‚Çì's already proven minimal could possibly get
knocked out by a new one.  So the only question I need to ask
under these circumstances is whether any of the previously
collected g‚Çì's is below g'.  If so, then g' can be ignored.

Perhaps this means rather that I should switch to finding g‚Çì‚Çä‚ÇÅ?
That is, I may now have a scheme for processing the hypercube
in a single pass.
*/

% Today, let's see how much we can speed this up by such a
% single-pass processing of a sorted hypercube.
% This really starts to look like a job for a DCG!
% But perhaps a foldl/4 is more clearly in order.
% I will need a suitable _accumulator_ for this.
% Accumulator at any time knows the full list of (D+1)
% maximal strata which the g‚Çì's must sit above.
% Accumulator also knows for which X it is currently
% seeking a g‚Çì.  (It may rather make sense for accumulator
% to hold only current and yet-unprocessed strata.)
% Since my aim here is to explore *potential* speedups,
% I could even treat first g‚Çì I find for each X as *the*
% minimal one!  That is, I am announcing from the outset
% that I will seek only single representatives of what may
% generally (unless some theorem holds to the contrary!)
% be non-singleton g‚Çì lists of options for some X's.

% Are any of these pharmacologic non-monotonicities genuinely new?

% the top dose is removed.

% TODO: Bring the following explorations up-of-date
%       with our now-expanded ‚âº.

% Might there be some small handful of *decision-points*

% by {0,1,...,D}.
%
% Accordingly, our process of 'discovery' can proceed by
% identifying these disjoint sets, and then seeking simple
% descriptions of them in terms of our partial order ‚âº.

% followed [per-protocol] by enrec at a dose _below_ X.
% Thus, if we use the Mx to select (cascading top-down) the
% next dose [en/rec TBD] for each given tally, then we may
% end up with a /less cautious/ protocol than we derived
% the Mx from.

% farther down the road; the more pressing question is whether
% I can achieve reasonably close approximations to 3+3 protocol
% in the form of (upper/lower) Galois enrollments.

% Since if anything we ought to be interested in protocols

% well, except that it implicates also 3+3's maximum dose-wise
% enrollment constraint in addition to its dose-assignment rule
% (inasmuch as one can even discuss these elements separately).
%
% Let's ask what would happen if we followed lg3's rules:

%@    E = 2.
%?- lg3([0/3,1/10,1/3], E).
%@    E = 3. % INTERESTING!
% Wow!!  I didn't expect this at all!
% My intuition was that we would remain stuck forever at E=2.
% But now I'll hazard the guess that our 1:2 generator arrow
% (ie, r:=2) now yields enough linkage between adjacent doses
% to enable ultimately an escalation out of E=2.
% This is a really important discovery, since it opens up the
% possibility of abstracting dose-escalation rules from trial
% size limits, allowing analysis of ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES.
% This, in turn, suggests that dose-escalation protocols of
% this general form (ie, Galois, or at least _lower_-Galois)
% hold enough promise to be worth exploring _systematically_,
% searching with high degrees of freedom, far beyond simple
% heuristics such as d_meetscascade/2 and d_joinscascade/2.
% Accordingly, I'll need to resume work on the visualization,
% and bring that to a usable state!
